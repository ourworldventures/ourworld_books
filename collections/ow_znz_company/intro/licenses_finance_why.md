# The timing is perfect.

The pandemic was the ultimate resilience test for the banking industry at large. The global financial system is experiencing unprecedented growth in digitization, convergence of industries and ecosystems, and more. The explosion of the digital asset market is transforming financial architectures and will have a revolutionary impact on how money is created, transferred, stored and owned. 

The efforts from governments to flood markets with cash in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic has proved a double-edged sword for banks by propping up borrowers but leaving institutions flooded with excess cash. Banks and countries are entering a technology trap by approaching their digital transformation in an incremental, fragmented and localized way, preventing them from achieving their fullest potential. These trends are pushing banking leaders to redefine the workspace. 

Bank executives have a clear opportunity to lead in a more authentic and differentiated way that embraces a higher purpose. Many banks are yet to prioritize their commitments to environmental, social and governance (ESG) concerns, having the power to impact climate change and financial inclusion. Now, more than ever, banks should be bold and aggressive in orchestrating change at a pace and scale that will drive results. The window for decisive action is closing soon.
