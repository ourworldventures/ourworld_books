# OurWorld Company = Digital Finance

![](img/digifin1.png)  

OurWorld Company is the organization which collaborates with the Zanzibar government to provide financial regulatory services and technology to its customers. It is a fully automated financial framework for the self-sovereign and sustainable digital freezone bridging Africa and the rest of the world. 

Our unique proposition is that we will become a license and service provider which uses twin technology to aggregate all the following features into a single, very simple, consumable package including:

- Any required licenses
- Much required technology (All infrastructure and blockchain tech)
- Third-party processing with global fiat currencies 
- Auditing services & automatic tax reporting
- Facility services (office, houses for staff, ...)

All these features will be provided by and hosted on OurHub's [OurLedger Blockchain](/ourinternet/ourledger/ourledger.md), the decentralised internet infrastucture of the new [cybercity](/ourtown/ourtown.md). 

## The timing is ideal

- There is a large and fast growing international market for digital banking: The global digital banking market size was valued at $8 trillion in 2020 and is growing at a CAGR of 5% from 2021 to 2027. The E-Bank (Neo/Challenger Bank) market size was valued at USD 28.73 Billion in 2020 and is projected to reach USD 627.99 Billion by 2028, growing at a CAGR of 47.17% from 2021 to 2028.
- There are no financial systems globally that provide the KYC/AML and residency requirements of digital nomads.
- The tokenization of various assets such as precious metals, land and more represents a substantial opportunity to rapidly build an international customer base.
- The advent of peer-to-peer, autonomous financial systems provide the ideal platform for affordable, simple and efficient credit-union disbursement-platforms and remittence transactions across the world.
