## Helping digital nomads overcome the issues they face

![](img/digital_nomads_issues.png)  


As a digital nomad, one of the most crucial things to ensure is that you have the proper paperwork and that you are aware of your legal responsibilities. This is one of the most important things when you decide to live and work on the road. If they are neglected, you might face some major difficulties. Combined with concerns over employment and residence, it can create many stressful and often unknown challenges for newbie digital nomads.

A few of the most common challenges that digital nomads face include: 
* keeping finances in check
* being able to deliver quality work all the time
* loneliness and homesickness
* a non-existant or always changing routine
* a lack of work-life balance
* constant traveling that wears one down. 

Digital nomads have no fixed residence, which complicates the organizing of their business affairs. As a result, most choose to live "off the grid", operating informally and on a cash basis or through personal, pre-pandemic online banking relationships.

B2B transactions can also be difficult and time-consuming due to the challenges presented by performing due diligence on digital nomads. 

By gaining access to the Digital Twin IT system, the business life of digital nomads is simplified. The capablities of the twin make it easier for nomads to tackle many of the challenges they face. For instance, Digital Twin financial tools would facilitate invoicing and accounting while project management, communication and storage tools, amongst others, would optimise work delivery. Besides, having access to a community of digital nomads, organically created, would help keep feelings of loneliness at bay and improve quality of life. Another advantage of joining OURHUB is that they will have a safe-haven to return to when they need a greater level of stability.

All in all, the Zanzibar Digital Freezone (OURHUB) will provide digital nomads with a simple, reliable means to formalizing their businesses and facilitating commercial relationships in a manner that increases productivity and decreases risk, while at the same time generating revenue for Zanzibar.
