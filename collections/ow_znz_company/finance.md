## No banks in Phase 1

To keep things simple, there are no banks involved in phase 1, however we do provide many powerful financial tools and licenses.
Initially, only wrapped and native tokens / digital currencies can be used.

## Native Tokens

Every company will have the ability to register their own tokens inside the OurLedger Blockchain using our powerful tools.

## Integration in OurWorld Company Services

We will provide the capability to integrate many digital currencies and tokens into the sandbox, for example gold tokens. In 2023, it could be possible for people to enter the sandbox by buying gold. This gold could come from sustainable sources to ensure that our integrations match our ethos.
