### Benefits for Digital Nomads

#### Zero Complexity

Our unique digital twin IT system allows a digital nomad to simplify his personal business life.

#### Quality of Life

Within OurHub, nomads will have the following capabilities:  

* Communication (messaging, email, video conferencing)
* Invoicing, Expenses, Accounting and other administrative tasks
* Data Storage (all  data is stored securely online)
* Contract management with employers, business partners and service providers
* HR relations
* Personal and collaborative project management
* Digital currency wallet 

Every task  is 100% automated and peer-to-peer with business counterparts, requiring no manual action. For example, invoices are generated and sent digitally and securely (and permanently recorded on a blockchain).ß

#### Preparation for an unsure future

Whatever might happen in the nomad’s homeland, their company and assets are safe and secure in a well-regulated online environment. New capabilities will be added over time as OurHub expands organically and its growth potential  is clear.

In particular, as the use of token-based currency models (security tokens, utility tokens, digital currencies) grows, OurHub will provide this capability for its communities. 

Prepare for the future, digital tokens will become increasingly important.
