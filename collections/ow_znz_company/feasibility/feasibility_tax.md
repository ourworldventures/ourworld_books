# Tax Feasability

The setup of an attractive regulatory framework will be key to harness the development of OurWorld and attract international investors and SMEs.

Real estate investors should be able to acquire a residency permit as an investor, meaning the party will be allowed to live in Zanzibar as a non-citizen. They are also not required to live in Zanzibar permanently.
