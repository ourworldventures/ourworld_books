# Technology feasibility

## Team Experience

ThreeFold has an experienced team which can help to realize the goals of this project:

Our incubator (Incubaid) has founded several technology startups.

## ThreeFold Technology

ThreeFold has created a more decentralized technology stack. We believe that more decentralized systems have the ability to bring more security, scale and are more positive for people and the planet.

## The ThreeFold Technology stack is operational:

- **Capacity Generators**: a (secure and autonomous) operating system that does not rely on people to operate and maintain it. This operating system has simple and secure primitives that it can execute.  It can run on most computers and servers and is very secure.
- **Workload Orchestration**: instead of using people (system administrators) use blockchains and smart contracts to start and stop applications and create and manage storage solutions.  This lowers the dependency in people and creates security, reliability, scalability and efficiency.
- **Data Transport**: a networking protocol that connects it all in a more reliable and secure way.  It enables compute and storage capacity generators to be created everywhere and not just in well connected and serviced locations like datacenters.  Build a local, sovereign internet based on homes, schools, universities and company or government buildings.

### Proof of concept active in our Internet of Internets Approach

The current mainnet is a global network of Internet capacity generators and spans 60+ countries.

Planning forward the expansion model of the Internet of Internets is to have countries, tribes and regions take ownership of local **capacity generation**, **workload orchestration** and **data transport**.

Compute, Storage and Network (IT capacity) generation is the starting point for a new capable digital backbone system which can be used for any future digital workload.  

Capacity generation can be done in any location that has reliable power and network infrastructure.  

- homes
- community centers
- schools
- city halls
- market places
- commercial buildings
- office buildings
- government buildings

The better the electricity and network reliability in a location, the better suited they are to create capacity (network, compute and storage).  

In places where there is no infrastructure yet an edge datacenter can be created:
