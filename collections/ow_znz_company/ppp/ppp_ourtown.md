## OurTown

### highlights of service

- (re)sell of homes or commercial properties (not as straight property, is through tokenized structure)
- rental of homes/commercial property (offices, resto, ...)
- deliver all required commodities for a small city (electricity, water, some local food production to demonstrate, telecom, ...)
- operate the [OurLedger](/ourinternet/ourledger/ourledger.md) = OurLedger Blockchain 
- be a global recognized example of how a digital community based can be run on larger scale by using digital tools
- promotion to attract startups into OurTown and provide value that way for TNZ
- do expositions and organze events to show how the OurTown model works and provides prosperity for government as well as citizens.

Once all of this is proven and is working on larger scale we can consider to roll our parts of this model e.g. OurLedger to rest of Zanzibar with ofcourse 100% collaboration of government.

### Partnership model

- the land is separated in common area's (owned by OurTown e.g. for rentals) or as owned (fractional by members)
    - all land is registered in [OurLedger Blockchain ](/ourinternet/ourledger/ourledger.md) and serves as example how land and property can be managed
- for land as owned by citizens of OurTown
    - 2000 USD per hectare (10.000m2) per year, only once used & sold
    - all is registered in [OurLedger Blockchain ](/ourinternet/ourledger/ourledger.md)
- for land as owned by OurTown
    - 15% of all rent -> ZNZ (offices as well as residential) and utilities
    - all is registered in [OurLedger Blockchain ](/ourinternet/ourledger/ourledger.md)
- VAT of 15% on services & goods
    - for all goods & services sold in OurTown Locations
    - all is registered on [OurLedger Blockchain ](/ourinternet/ourledger/ourledger.md) and serves as example how Revenue Collection can be automated.
    - this allows for incredible automation & transparancy

> all money is collected digitally on the OurLedger and transfered to ZNZ once a month, ZNZ can at any point in time audit the OurLedger and has full insight in all information on OurLedger, nice reporting tools will be created to give good insight to ZNZ government.
