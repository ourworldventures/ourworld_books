# Public Private Partnership

According to ThreeFold's analysis in conjunction with the Government of Zanzibar's strategic objectives and financial goals, the OurWorld project is projected to deliver an inclusive strategic fintech vision in line with the ICT objectives of the government of Zanzibar through a public-private-partnership (PPP). OurWorld's scope was broadened to include:

- An international hub for digital nomads and small and medium enterprises (SMEs)
- A sustainable cybercity project 
- A fully automated, self-sovereign and sustainable digital freezone also for financial licenses (phase 2)

The projects will be supported by the government of Zanzibar to guide the procurement, selection and development process of all projects involved in the realisation of that fintech vision for Zanzibar. 

In partnership with the government of Zanzibar, OurWorld will advocate on behalf of the PPP to ensure the selected development teams will further the country' goals in regards to fintech, social and environmental progress. 

As of Q3/Q4 2022, the planning and design of the project is on track and ThreeFold continues to serve as a partner to the government of Zanzibar, providing continuous support and attending meetings related to the vision of the country.


### The suggested PPP is a ```Build-Own-Operate-Transfer```

In this model, the government grants a franchise to a private partner to finance, design, build and operate a facility for a specified period of time. Ownership of the facility is transferred back to the public sector at the end of that period.

Our period is 33 years.

We want to design our partnership following the guidelines as described by:

- [tanzania ppp](https://pppnode.go.tz/)

### Requirements

- Government support to fast track the registrations and tax requirements for the first startups prior to the completion of OurTown and OurHub. 
- Government to provide +1,000,000m2 in a prime location in Zanzibar to start the OurTown project.
