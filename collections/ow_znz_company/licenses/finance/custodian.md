# Digital Custodian License (not a bank)

![](img/custodian.png)  

A custodian is a financial institution that holds customers' securities for safekeeping to prevent them from being stolen or lost. The custodian may hold stocks, bonds, or other assets in electronic or physical form on behalf of its customers.

Often, a custodian does more than provide asset protection. It can manage customers' accounts and transactions, manage the settlement of financial transactions, account for the status of assets, and ensure compliance with tax regulations.

It safeguards assets and is not engaged in "traditional" commercial or consumer/retail banking like lending. 

> Specific for OurWorld Company, our digital custodian services are digital only and 99% automated, they do not giving banking powers to the operator nor do they allow the operator to provide financial investment services. The only non automated functions are storing commodities like precious metals and registeri Â§ng and checking of share holdings (done by certified 3e parties).

## What can a OurWorld Company Custodian Do

- allow their customers to create digital assets.
- hold in safekeeping assets/securities such as shares, commodities such as precious metals and currency (cash), domestic and foreign
- provide information on the securities and their issuers
- maintain currency/cash bank accounts (integration with financial partner e.g. an EMI from our OURTOWN)
- perform additional services for clients such as fund accounting, administration, legal, compliance and tax support services (all automated)
- allow customers to sell securities (assets) to each other as long as they are both customers of the custodian.
- A custodian bank may have the right to take possession of assets if required, often in conjunction with a power of attorney (is digital). This allows the custodian bank to perform actions on behalf of a client, such as making payments.

> The custodian does not become at any point the owner of the securities, but is only a part of the registration chain linking the owners to the securities.

## Key Takeaways

- These assets may be stored in physical or electronic form.
- Custodian banks can also manage financial accounts, handle settlements, and deal with compliance and tax issues (we have all automated this process).
- Custodian banks can serve as mutual fund custodians.
