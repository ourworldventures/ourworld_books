# PSP License

![](img/psp.png)  

OurWorld Company aims to provide Payment Service Provider (PSP) licences to businesses and merchants. A payment service provider (PSP) is a company which provides merchants with individual merchant accounts, helps them with merchant underwriting and payment processing but does not fund merchants directly. 

PSP is a necessity in the digital age, offering online shopping services through electronic payments by using methods like direct debit, credit card, online bank transfer etc. while acting as a mediator between banks and customers. In simple words, it is an online payment solution for multiple channels, including mobile and online store.

Currently, E-Commerce is booming around the world, and people are opting for online shopping and paying online as well. 
PSPs are critical for any financial ecosystem and country as they provide their residents and customers with the support for their multiple payment methods and currencies.

## PSP architecture

Payment gateways:
- Work as direct customer intercommunication
- Connect different systems, such as card processing platforms and point of sale (POS) systems
- Provide the connectivity for retailers to access their payment processors
- Allow configuring the appropriate gateways in various ways for both in-store and online businesses

Payment services:
- Work in the background to facilitate the interaction of payment gateways
- Transfer financial data between merchant accounts and gateways
- Ensure all transactions are processed properly, efficiently, and quickly

## How does a PSP work?

![](img/psp_how.png)  

- Each time a customer enters their card details and clicks ‘pay’, a transaction request is sent to the OurWorld Company payment gateway (blockchain based).
- The PSP blockchain then verifies that the customer’s card or digital wallet holds the required funds to make the payment. The PSP does this with the help of a payment processor in case of FIAT.
- Once the customer’s card or digital wallet details are verified, the PSP either confirms or declines the payment according to the funds available. If confirmed, the PSP initiates the transfer of funds from the customer’s account to the associated merchant account.
- Finally, the PSP sends a transaction notification to the customer and the merchant to confirm the payment's completion.
- In the case of a declined transaction due to invalid card details or insufficient funds, the PSP will terminate the transaction and send a status message notifying the customer and the merchant of the failed payment.

In summary, a PSP ensures secure and efficient transfer of funds between customers and merchants. That being said, there are other benefits that PSPs offer business owners in addition to facilitating payments. Signing up with a PSP offers several advantages, from transaction reporting, to the ability to accept multiple payment methods in multiple currencies.

## Additional advantages of using a PSP under OurWorld Company

### Accept multiple payment methods:

PSPs provide support for several payment methods through a single channel, ensuring your customers can conveniently choose from a variety of options. This level of accessibility supports customer satisfaction. Integrating different payment methods such as online banking, credit cards, debit cards, and e-wallets to your business can incur costs, but signing up with a PSP makes the whole process hastle-free. There are only two types of fees you need to pay: a one-time set-up fee, and a small monthly fee for enabling payments.

### Make transactions securely:

All information sent through a transaction request is controlled by the PSP. This information is heavily encrypted using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption, ensuring only the customer can view their banking or financial information. This provides customers a better sense of security, and encourages them to go through with the payment.

### Prevent fraud:

PSPs only initiate transfers of funds once the customer’s card details and funds availability are verified. This prevents merchants and business to be compromised by fraudulent transactions.

### Accept multiple currencies:

PSPs provide support for multiple currencies to enable fast and secure cross-border payments. This is important for business planning to expand their presence abroad. 

OurWorld Company has access to a third-party processor with +17 global currencies integrated with VISA, Mastercard and UnionPay. By integrating them to our platform, we aim to streamline international PSP services from day 1. 

### Get monthly reports on payments:

Most PSPs offer monthly reporting features for business payments and transactions. Through automation, PSPsS can provide real-time reporting features (accounts payable, reconciliation, expense management, tax reports etc..) at an affordable cost.

### Add new payment methods easily:

PSPs allow people and businesses to expand their payment methods seamlessly. New payment options are being created regularly to simplify customers and merchants experiences. Leading PSPs integrate these new options fast to remain up-to-date with the latest payment methods, automatically making them available to you.

### Opening accounts with acquiring banks:

Before accepting card payments, a business has to set up a merchant account with an acquiring bank. PSPs can support businesses by fast tracking their applicationss with the acquiring banks. PSPs can also have pre-existing accounts with acquiring banks, allowing businesses to get sub-accounts under the pre-existing PSP accounts. This makes the whole process of setting up a merchant's account much easier, as these accounts are already approved and functioning.

### Reconcile transactions easily:

PSPs provide complete transaction reports for all of your payment methods. This makes it easier for you to reconcile transactions in the future.
