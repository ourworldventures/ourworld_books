# EMI license (Electronic Money Institution)

![](img/emi1.png)  

Every company engaged in issuing electronic currencies in Zanzibar should obtain an E-money license to legally operate in this jurisdiction. Having a license will allow offline/online payments, providing sub-accounts within a bank account, creating electronic wallets, providing individual IBANs, and transferring money to foreign accounts.

Holders of a Zanzibar e-money license are allowed to provide the above services in the different country unions of Tanzania  such as Africa Union, SADEC and COMESA without having to obtain an additional license in another African state. This license is passported for these activities, which allows you to work in other countries of the region. In addition, an entrepreneur may obtain a limited EMI license and provide its services only in Zanzibar. In this case, certain restrictions may apply to the company's turnover.

The submitted documentation for the EMI license will be reviewed by the Central Bank of Tanzania within 3 months from the first day of submission. The decision to issue an EMI license will be made after the review, within the same 3 months. If there are shortcomings in the documentation related to the form of the document and its content, the regulatory authority may request corrected forms or missing data on regulatory requirements.

## Costs

Application fee: $350,000. The fee is paid when you submit your licence application. 

Note: This fee doesn't incur the initial capital nor consultancy fees and does not guarantee that the applicant will get the licence itself. See E-Money Licence steps for more info.
