# D-Money License

![](img/dmi.png)  

Every company engaged in issuing digital currencies in Zanzibar should obtain an D-money license to legally operate in this jurisdiction. Having a license will allow:

- The exchange of digital currencies for FIAT and vice versa.
- To operate customer wallets to store digital currencies under a custodian. 

Holders of a Zanzibar d-money license are allowed to provide the above services in the different country unions of Tanzania  such as Africa Union, SADEC and COMESA without having to obtain an additional license in another African state. This license is passported for these activities, which allows you to work in other countries of the region. In addition, an entrepreneur may obtain a limited DMI license and provide its services only in Zanzibar. 

The submitted documentation for the DMI license will be reviewed by the Central Bank of Tanzania within 1-3 months from the first day of submission. The decision to issue an DMI license will be made after the review, within the same 1-3 months. If there are shortcomings in the documentation related to the form of the document and its content, the regulatory authority may request corrected forms or missing data on regulatory requirements.

## Licenses Integrated
