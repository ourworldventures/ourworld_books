![](img/security.png)  

OurHub is strongly protected against many types of threats and compliant with all necessary legislation


### Legal Framework, 100% in line with regulations.

We use the legal tools available to create a full legal sandbox in line with all published regulations. 

A good enough legal framework needs to be implemented, a simple set of regulations is needed, we will work together with other offshore centers to get all the starting information. Official judges and lawyers are available in Zanzibar to provide support when required, if not required Judges and Lawyers who are members of the sandbox can be certified as well to operate in Zanzibar in the sandbox.

### Proof of Authenticity and No Anonymity 

Every party with which you do business in the sandbox is registered on the blockchain and has their identity verified.

Every person needs to keep a profile page updated and a proof-of-authenticity mechanism is used to make sure the information you provide is accurate. An interweaving network of credibility requires parties to receive affirmations of credibility, and KYC & AML are done when entering the sandbox.

### Shariah Compliant products.

There will be the option for our customers to do business in a Shariah-compliant way, and will be developed according to customer needs and preferences.

### Verifiable Information

Source-code based, all information used towards sandbox or in any business relationship is complete, version controlled and can be inspected by all involved parties at any time. 

All information is archived forever and verified on the blockchain in the sandbox and therefore cannot be manipulated.

**What you see is what you get!** (proof of authenticity of all information)
