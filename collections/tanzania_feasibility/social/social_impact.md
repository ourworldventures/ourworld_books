### Social Impact

The World Bank (WB) upgraded Tanzania’s country classification by income level from low income to lower-middle income in 2020-21. The WB assigns the world’s economies to four income groups—low, lower-middle, upper-middle, and high-income countries, based on their GNI per capita in current USD. 
- Low income is defined as less than USD 1,036 in 2020 (USD 1,026 in 2019)
- Lower-middle income is between USD 1,036 and USD 4,045 (USD 1,026 – 3,995 in 2019)
- upper-middle income is between USD 4,046 – USD 12,535 (USD 3,996 – 12,375 in 2019)
- high income is any higher than USD 12,535 (>USD12,375 in 2019).

TSIP must enable the social upliftment of Tanzanian people and afford every citizen universal and impartial access to the necessary civil services to ensure their individual success and well being, Critical success factors in delivering on the above are the fundamental attributes of TSIP, including:

**Sovereign Digital Identity** 

  In the digital era, the starting point to our success as digital citizens is ensuring our digital sovereignty identity. Freeflow life is our digital twin in the internet economy and is a verified and immutable representation of us as a digital citizen.

  Looking at all of us as an internet and a country citizens our identities are not linked between the physical and the digital world.  Almost every country, region, city or social community has their own requirements and way of handling identity.  This is replicated in the digital world a 100 times over where every online company, service or platform has their own digital identity requirements.

  This complete fragmentation of identities leads to a lot of complexity for people (citizens) to manage their identity. Most people manage this complexity by using the same username and password everywhere.  This lowers the security of these identities and causes a lot of breaches because once one service or platform is hacked this potentially  exposes the username and password for many other platforms as well.

  One, sovereign, technically well designed and built digitial identity solves all of these issues.

**Data Sovereignty & Privacy**

For Tanzanian people most (if not all) of the internet services that are available are invented and operated by foreign companies using private technology.  The result of this a working service, but also that all (meta) data created and stored is governed by foreign laws.

Citizens, companies and the government of Tanzania have little to no control over what happens with the data processes and stored in these online services. The use of foreign services results in a net negative contribution to the Gross Domestic Product.  

To achieve data sovereignty and privacy the data and processing of it needs to be done on Tanzanian soil, governed by Tanzanian law and create plus operated by Tanzanian inhabitants.

**Digital Productivity**

Digital disruption may be an accomplished fact for consumers enjoying ever more innovation, and for the firms driving it, but there is little evidence of macroeconomic disruption. Despite the relentless transformation of the user experience, the idea of meaningfully higher productivity growth across the economy remains wishful thinking. Especially for Tanzania where most of the digitial disruption has happened by large foreign companies who have extracted a lot of value from the Tanzanian economy.

To make the maximum productivity impact first the value extraction from tha Tanzanian economy to the digital giants has to decrease and if possible stopped. For this to happen Tanzania needs to invest and create sovereign solutions to these global giants.  This is the first step to start building local momentum to help to increase the productivity in the broadest sense to help the Tanzanian economy to get a boost from digitial services and enablement.

**Universal Digital Access**

As recognized by the United Nations and featuring in many of their reports:

"*The Internet has become one of the most important vehicles by which individuals exercise their right to freedom of opinion and expression, and it can
play an important role to promote human rights, democratic participation, accountability, transparency and economic development.*"

Access to the Internet is widely recognized as an indispensable enabler of a broad range of human rights It is not only essential for freedom of expression, but, as digitalization advances, it is also central to the realization of the rights to education, to freedom of association and assembly, to participate in social, cultural and political life, to health, to an adequate standard of living, to work and to social and economic development, to name just a few.

Affording every citizen universal access to valuable content, networks and resources to promote the health, education and welfare of the people of Tanzania, including:
- Universal access to education
- Universal access to financial services
- Universal access to healthcare services
- Universal access to information in general
