The world bank has been supporting the digital business indicators initiative in researching the best regulatory and policy practices for governments seeking to promote their digital economy, especially from the lens of ease-of-doing business.  Digital business indicators measure the laws, regulations, and bureaucratic processes that impact digital businesses in various countries, especially in the areas of data privacy and security, logistics, payment, and digital market regulations.
