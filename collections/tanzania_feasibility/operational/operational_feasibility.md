## Operational Feasibility

<!--
Operations – Global; Local (land availability, proposed locations for servers)
 
- Global Team
- Management structure; organogram
  -  Personnel
  -  Finance & Budget

Local (ZNZ)
-  Footprint – HQ location, management, staff
-  Responsibilities (vis-à-vis Global Team)        

- TNZ Deployment
  - Requirements for locations (map some maps)
  - Locations, …
  - Link between m2 land & generator or power feed
    - Connectivity
    - Link to other projects e/g. Fiber backend
    - Link to telcos
    - Deployment Specs (Kristof)
    - Explain the 3 options how it can be deployed (2-3 pages), explain pros and cons for each 
    - More detailed specs container version (kristof, 5-8 pages)

### Tanzania farm designs

The farm design need to follow population density numbers, power and network strengths and real estate options available. The initial [research](./requirements_composite.md) shows that the following areas are the most densely populated areas:

-  Dar Es Salam (7,404,689)
-  Pemba Island (406,808)
-  Morogoro (305,840)
-  Tanga (273,332)
-  Dodoma  (410,956)
-  Zanzibar Island (766, 392)

Let's design 3 types of nodes that covers more than 12.5% of the Tanzanian population.  Two type of 3nodes setups for Dar Es Salam and Zanzibar.

#### Design 1
A farm that consists of a rack of x nodes, with the following characteristics:
- resides in a state owned or government building
  - government building
  - university
  - libraries
  - ...
- redundant and reliable power
- redundant and reliable network
- physical security of the farm

#### Design 2
A number of servers (x) that exits in
-  solid stone real estate
-  single power availability with UPS system providing 2 hr power failure coverage
-  single network connection
-  reasonable physical security

#### Design 3
Single unit that can exist anywhere.
- property that can sustain a computer of sorts
- power, no redundancy
- network, no redundancy
