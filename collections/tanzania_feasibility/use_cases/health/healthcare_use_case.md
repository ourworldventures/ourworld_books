# TSIP: Healthcare Use Case #

Healthcare is a fundamental right for every single member of society and the Tanzaznian goverment carries the responsibility for healthcare delivery as a primary civil service. 

The challenge in most emerging markets is the lack of healthcare professionals and infrastructure relative to the needs of the community and the size of the population itself. This imbalance poses significant challenges for goverment who simply do not have enough budget, skilled professionals nor infrastructure to meet the needs of its citizens in this regard.

Based on our research, the situation on the ground in Tanzania mirrors this exact dilemma whereby the shortage of budget, infrastructure and healthcare professionals relative to the needs of the cmmunity results in sub par service delivery on behalf of the government.

### So how do we scale and optimise healthcare delivery given these constraints ? ###

The simple answer to scaling healthcare delivery given these constraints is:

### 1. DATAFICATION ###
### 2. VIRTUALISATION ###
### 3. TOKENISATION ###

explained as follows...

## 1. Datafication ##

By definition,  is a technological trend turning many aspects of our life into datail which is subsequently transferred into information realised as a new form of value

In simple terms, this is the collection of healthcare data and aggregation of medical records to establish a full patient medical history (medical 360), gain key insights and idenitfy macro health trends and unlock the value of real time data for the benefit of every citizen/ patient.

This process involves both historical data aggregation and real time data collection:

### Historical Data ###
Based on a an EMR (electronic medical record) is the aggregation of all historical data from all possible legacy data sources to establish a single and full perspective on a patient history. This single healthcare record per citizen is:
  - guaranteed private and always in the control of the citizen who owns that data
  - stored in quantum safe storage on the TSIP network
  - secured and ensured immutable by the TSIP blockchain 
  
### Real Time Data ### 
Based on being able to collect and diagnose real time information from patients via a cirtual healthcare platform, enabling healthecare professionals more insights and data points on which they can make a diagnosis and recommend an appropriate treatment protocol. In this case:
  -  data collection is deviceless meaning the patient needs nothing more than a smartphone to provide this information realtime, in virtual consultation
  - data is measured by the smartphone camera and uploaded to the patient EMR record for diagnosis by the healthcare professional
  - data is collecte dreal time but is stored and associated to an active consultation which can be queued awaiuting the availability of a healtcare professional who can in due course, use the data to formulate a diagnosis and recommedn a treatment proitocol. 
  
## 1. VIrtualisation: ## 
In computing terms, virtualisation is the act of creating a virtual (rather than actual) version of something at the same abstraction level.

In simple terms, to virtualise healthcare delivery means to digitalise the whole patient experience so far as possible. In essence, make the end to end healthcare process an online experience and minimise the need for a patient to visit a healthcare facility and see a healthcare professionals in person.

In practice, this is essentially telemedicine, but in this case, with some fundamental diofferences vs  what the industry today recognises. Telemendicine has advanced our ability to deliver healthcare signifucantly by virtuakisibg the atient epxerince and essentially bringing healthcare professionals to the patient via an application. Hoiwever, whist this has realised signifuicant efficiency in healthcare service delivery, there are stiull obvious limitations in telemedicine as it is today with regards to the scope of practice that can be delivered via a virtual service.

The limitations referred to above is that only minor conditions can be consulted and diagnosed via a virtual platform given the lack of data available between the patienta nd the healthcare proifessional. This lack of hiostiorical and more importantly, real time data is a major limiting factor in the types of cases that can be dealt with in an online virtual experience

## Tokenisation: ## 

In technical terms, Tokenisation is the process by which an issuer creates digital tokens on a distributed ledger or blockchain, which represent either digital or physical assets.

In simple terms, a token is a digital representation of something that has inherent value. This can be financial, asset based or other.

Relative to this context, tokenisation means the digitisation of the health budget to allow for simple and fair distribution of value. 

In this case, we refer to a ditial token, backed and representing the national health budget, remittable for the redemption of healthcare services on behalf of the government by the citizens of Tazania.

In practice, the process can be as simple as follows:
- the national healthcare budget is tokenised and minted on the blockchain in a fully automated process
- these digital tokens, representing healthcare services by the government, are distributed electronically to the digital wallet of each citizen (typically the digital wallet is on their cellular phone) on a equitable basis.
- citizens then have the means to redeem virtual healthcare services redeemed using the inherent value ion the digital tokens they were issued.

This process of tokenisation ensures:
- equitable distribution of value between all citizens
- concise and immutable management of budget and resources
- key insights and data trends such as:
  - how healthcare infrastructure and resources are utilised
  - spend per citizen on healthcare
  - annual cycles in health related problems
  - geographical data insights realtive to spending and health trends
  - etc

## Solution Overview ##

A truly virtualised healthcare solution, including tokenisation and datafication (as above) is underpinned by the decentralised, autonomous infrastructure of TSIP.

TSIP delivers on the fundamental requirements to ensure the Virtual Healthcare solution lives up to its promise of:

- privacy
- soverigenty
- security (quantum safe)
- immutability
- scalability
- ...

Architecturally, the virtual healthcare solution is depicted as follows:



Layer 0: TSIP Network
Layer 1: Threefold Blockchain
Layer 2: Experiences layer where virtual healthcare platform is deployed

## Key desigbn principles: ##

- Patient Centric: conversely to the industry norm, VHP is designed around the patient, putting the patient first. Historically, the patient would always go tot he practitioner, at the halethcare facility. Medi.me is 100% patient centric and birng all practitioners, insurers, service providers to the patient
- Verifiable Identification: all actors within the ecosystem are verified by a Sovereign identity. No BAD Actors
- Immutable Records:
- Tokenised Assets
-
