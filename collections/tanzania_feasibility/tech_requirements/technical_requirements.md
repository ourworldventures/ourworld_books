### Technical requirements

The feasibility study is architected around the Tanzanian countries demographics and technical infrastructure availability.  For a  decentralized internet priority number one is to model it around communities and size around community / population density. The driver is to have digital assets located as close as possible to the actual owner of the digital asset (data).  Demographic data drives the initial layout of the local internet structure.

The second driver is utility availability. The country utilities which are major drivers for this are power and network (internet) connectivity.  Power and internet access availability is considered in two categories:
- existing real estate with reliable power and network connectivity
- existing real estate without reliable power and network connectivity

Initially we are going to focus on real estate that has existing reliable power and network available. The process to determine what areas are in scope for the feasibility study to prove that the internet infrastructure is able to power enablement use cases will follow these technical requirements, in the following order:
1. population density
2. power and  network availability and reliability
3. access to real estate
