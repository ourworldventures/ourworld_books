## Technical Considerations {#technology-considerations}

- Broken down by Project - what is required, what exists, what must be built? 
- Unbreakable Internet will require consistent, reliable electricity
- Section must include detailed analysis of power requirements & how we’re going to keep the juice flowing 365/7/24.
- ZESCO, renewables (solar?  land?); back up diesel; fuel storage (?); economics of various options?
  - Nomads, eBanking, Incubator - what are technical requirements?  
- Analysis of existing internet infrastructure and sufficiency for project; what are necessary improvements?   Who will undertake?  What is Capex requirement?
- Key element will be integrating technology into existing government functions – including corporate registry, others.  How will this be accomplished?  Are existing ZNZ systems capable of integration?
- Section should definitely include screen-shots, diagrams, etc in order to provide tangible description/examples to facilitate understanding by non-technical readers.
-  Should discuss how projects can be developed concurrently or consecutively – what’s required for each (in particular, whether Unbreakable Internet is required for other projects and how it would be integrated with others if it comes later)
-  This should be detailed description, but include a succinct Executive Summary at the beginning

* Architecture TFGrid
* Why can data never be lost
* Why can 100% uptime be achieved
