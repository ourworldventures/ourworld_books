#### Population density

Decentralised internet deployments follow population distribution. Denser areas require more local capacity (more and larger deployments) while less densely populated areas can have sparser (and smaller deployments).  For the technical design of capacity instances and sizing  population demographics are key drivers.

This is a dated population density overview which provides a first insight into the population spread in Tanzania.  From the density map we can extract a key focus are map which looks liek this:

These highlighted areas are the areas that are of interest because they will have more likely than not all the required infrastructure and utility available to do a simple rollout of digital enabling infrastructure layer.
