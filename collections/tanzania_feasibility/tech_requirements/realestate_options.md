#### Real estate availability and reliability {#real-estate-availability-and-reliability}

A decentralized internet depends on capacity deployments in existing real estate. It uses data centers and telco space for some more densely populated areas but for the other (edge) deployments it requires existing real estate.  Also here deployments follow availability of reliable real estate.  To find appropriate locations of capacity deployments we should identify where:



* Realestate have utility rooms facilitation power and other utility in the building
* Reliable power and power backup (if available)
* Reliable network and network backup (if available)

Based on these criteria we can define technical feasibility for internet capacity deployments based on real estate characteristics availability.

Categories:



1. Telco grade datacenter or POP (including mobile mast).
2. Concrete and brick commercial, tower or office building (government, university, school or company owned)
3. Concrete and brick  Villa / Home  (individually owned)
4. Other

More detailed information on the rollout is formulated as follows:

| Priority / Phase | Private/Public sector sites |Community sites |
|-------------------------|----------------------------|-------------| 
| 1 | Telco (National and International) sites | Edge DC sites |
| 2 |Goverment sites, Colleges / School University sites | |
| 3 | Airports / Seaports |  Homes |
