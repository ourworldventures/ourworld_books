#### Composite overview of areas of interest. {#composite-overview-of-areas-of-interest}

Combining the power infrastructure and densely populated ares delivers the following primary areas of interest to consider for deploying decentralized internet capacity.

| Population density| Power grid availability|
|---|---|

Making these two source of areas of interest overlap we can clearly identify what the areas of interest are combined

The combination of this information leads to a phased approach for the feasibility study.  These phases look as follows:
