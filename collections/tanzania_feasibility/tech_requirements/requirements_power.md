#### Power availability and reliability

Power availability is a key technical driver for capacity deployments.  Power availability, quality and reliability are significant drivers for deployments

Categories:
1. Power type 1: Grid power, 24*7 available grid power + backup facility
2. Power type 2: Grid power, 24*7 available grid power - no backup facility
3. Power type 3: Grid power, sporadically available 
4. Power type 4: No grid power (solar, battery, generator).

The national grid (needs more research) is looking as follows:

We are getting more detailed and recent information on the power grid in Tanzania but this represents a first good start.  Everything that is considers close to the major power distribution lines is meant to be stable and reliable.  The further aways from these major power distribution lines, available power becomes scarcer and less reliable.

Extracting the areas where major powerlines bring sufficient quantity and quality power to operate installations.  These areas are the preferred areas to build a proof of concept in.
