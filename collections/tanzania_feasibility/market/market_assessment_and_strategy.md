Among Tanzania’s predominantly rural population (73 percent), economic growth has been limited. Inclusive, broad-based growth is hindered by low productivity growth in labour-intensive sectors like agriculture, which employs 77 percent of working age adults. The agriculture sector grew just 4 percent per year over the past decade.

The Tanzanian private sector’s vast financial resources and expertise in market-based solutions have the potential for tackling systemic societal challenges. Currently employing about 70 percent of the youth in Tanzania, the private sector provides a critical pathway to self-reliance.

USAID objectives include advancing Tanzania’s socio-economic status toward middle-income status by 2025; sustaining inclusive, broad-based economic growth; supporting private sector investment in energy as well as agriculture and natural resource-based tourism; and increasing the access of women and youth to resources and knowledge that allow them to take advantage of opportunities in these sectors.
