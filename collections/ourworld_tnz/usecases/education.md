# E-Education

The Internet has become an increasingly important feature of the learning environment for teenagers. Research shows that teens use the Internet as an essential study aid outside the classroom and that the Internet increasingly has a place inside the classroom.

Here are some of the significant global findings:

- 94% of youth ages 12-17 who have Internet access say they use the Internet for school research and 78% say they believe the Internet helps them with schoolwork.
- 71% of online teens say that they used the Internet as the major source for their most recent major school project or report.
- 41% of online teens say they use email and instant messaging to contact teachers or classmates about schoolwork.
- 34% of online teens have downloaded an online study aid.

The challenge in most emerging markets is the lack of infrastructure that supports teachers in providing a holistic educational framework and platform that can evolve to meet local student requirements. This imbalance poses significant challenges for goverment who simply don't have enough budget, skilled professionals nor infrastructure to meet its citizens' needs.

Based on our research, the situation on the ground in Tanzania mirrors the same dilemma whenever there is a shortage of budget, infrastructure and teachers relative to the community needs.
