# E-Health

Healthcare is a fundamental right for every single citizen, the Tanzaznian goverment carries the responsibility to deliver healthcare as a primary civil service. 

The challenge in most emerging markets is the lack of healthcare professionals and infrastructure relative to the needs of the community, and the size of the population. This imbalance poses significant challenges for goverment who simply don't have enough budget, skilled professionals nor infrastructure to meet its citizens' needs.

Based on our research, the situation on the ground in Tanzania mirrors the same dilemma whenever there is a shortage of budget, infrastructure and healthcare professionals relative to the community needs. It always results in sub-par service delivery of the government. 


## Scaling healthcare delivery

### Datafication

By definition, 'Datafication' is a technological trend turning many aspects of our life into data. This data is realised as a new form of value when it is subsequently transferred into information.

In simple terms, this is the collection of healthcare data and aggregation of medical records to establish a full patient medical history (medical 360). It allows to gain key insights, idenitfy macro health trends and unlock the value of real time data for the benefit of every citizen/patient.

This process involves both historical data aggregation and real time data collection:

#### Historical Data 

An EMR (electronic medical record) is the aggregation of all historical data from all possible legacy data sources to establish a single and full perspective on a patient history. There is a single healthcare record per citizen:
  - guaranteed private and always in the control of the citizen who owns that data
  - stored in quantum safe storage on the TSIP network
  - secured and immutable in the TSIP blockchain 
  
#### Real Time Data

Based on being able to collect and diagnose real time information from patients via a cvrtual healthcare platform, enabling healthecare professionals more insights and data points on which they can make a diagnosis, and recommend an appropriate treatment protocol. In this case:
  -  data collection is deviceless meaning the patient needs nothing more than a smartphone to provide his information real time, in virtual consultation
  - data is measured by the smartphone camera and uploaded onto the patient EMR record for diagnosis by the healthcare professional
  - data is collected real time but it is stored and associated to an active consultation which can be queued awaiting the availability of a healtcare professional who in due course, can use the data to formulate a diagnosis and recommend a treatment protocol. 
  
### Virtualisation

In computing terms, virtualisation is the act of creating a virtual (rather than actual) version of something at the same abstraction level.

In simple terms, to virtualise healthcare delivery means to digitalise the whole patient experience as far as possible. In essence, make the end to end healthcare process an online experience and minimise the need for a patient to visit a healthcare facility and see a healthcare professional in person.

In practice, it is tele-medicine, although in this case, there are some fundamental diofferences vs what the industry  recognises today. Tele-mendicine has advanced our ability to deliver healthcare significantly by virtualisibg the patient epxerince and by bringing healthcare professionals to the patient via an application. However, whist this has brought greater efficiency in healthcare service delivery, there are still obvious limitations with regards to the scope of practice that could be delivered via a virtual service.

The limitations referred to above are that only minor conditions can be consulted and diagnosed via a virtual platform given the lack of data available between the patient  and the healthcare proifessional. This lack of histiorical and more importantly real time data is still a major limiting factor in the type of cases that can be dealt with an online virtual experience.

More on this key constraint and how it can be overcome in the section below: ###

### Tokenisation:

In technical terms, Tokenisation is the process by which an issuer creates digital tokens on a distributed ledger or blockchain, which represent either digital or physical assets.

In simple terms, a token is a digital representation of something that has inherent value. This can be financial, asset based or other.

Relative to this context, tokenisation means the digitisation of the health budget to allow for simple and fair distribution of value. 

In this case, we refer to a digital token backed by, and representing the national health budget, remittable for the redemption of healthcare services on behalf of the government to the citizens of Tazania.

In practice, the process can be as simple as follows:

- the national healthcare budget is tokenised and minted on the blockchain in a fully automated process
- digital tokens, representing healthcare services by the government, are distributed electronically to the digital wallet of each citizen (typically the digital wallet is on their mobile phone) on a equitable basis.
- citizens have then the means to redeem virtual healthcare services using the inherent value of the digital tokens they were issued.

This process of tokenisation ensures:
- equitable distribution of value between all citizens
- concise and immutable management of budget and resources
- key insights and data trends such as:
  - how healthcare infrastructure and resources are utilised
  - spent per citizen on healthcare
  - annual cycles in health related problems
  - geographical data insights realtive to spending and health trends, etc.

## Solution Overview

A truly virtualised healthcare solution including tokenisation and datafication is underpinned by the decentralised, autonomous infrastructure of TSIP.

TSIP delivers on the fundamental requirements to ensure the Virtual Healthcare solution lives up to its promise of:

- privacy
- sovereignty
- security (quantum safe)
- immutability
- scalability
- ...

Architecturally, the virtual healthcare solution is depicted as follows:
Layer 0: TSIP Network
Layer 1: Threefold Blockchain
Layer 2: Experiences layer where virtual healthcare platform is deployed

## Key design principles: 

- Patient Centric: conversely to the industry norm, VHP is designed around the patient, putting him first. Historically, the patient would always go to he practitioner, at the healthcare facility. Medi.me is 100% patient centric and bring all practitioners, insurers, service providers to the patient
- Verifiable Identification: all actors within the ecosystem are verified by a Sovereign Identity (No BAD Actors)
- Immutable Records
- Tokenised Assets
