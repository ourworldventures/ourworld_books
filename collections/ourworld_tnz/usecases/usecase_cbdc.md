# Central Bank Digital Currency

![](img/cbdc5.png)  

Payment and settlement systems and services have become vital components of the economic life of contemporary societies. Over the last decades, they have gone through several waves of reforms that has changed the landscape of the national payments system (NPS), in virtually every country in the world. Yet, in the middle of the 20th century, as payment technology settled down, payment and settlement systems and services issues were still slightly neglected versus other aspects of the financial system. They were seen mostly as technical matters, or “plumbing”, to be dealt with by sub-units of IT departments at both the central and commercial banks.

Recently, the issuance of Central Bank digital currency (CBDC) has become a highly debated financial-sector topic worldwide. 

Rapidly evolving technology and its application to practically all areas of finance, but especially in the issuance of value in electronic forms, has made it possible for central banks to issue their own digital currency for widescale use. The international financial community is currently studying aspects of CBDC, from design to implementation, and the implications for the financial system, including policy, regulation, oversight and the economy more broadly.

CBDC innovative potential to make digital payment services universal, ubiquitous, and instantaneous in contemporary economies must be weighed against the potential risks. 

The World Bank asks for careful consideration of

- the availability of a sound legal and regulatory framework
- the availability of an efficient infrastructure that include 
    - information & communicationstechnology
    - identity
    - reliable network
- strong commitment of relevant stakeholders


A widely available CBDC for retail use could reinforce the central role of central bank money in today’s digital world. 

Where appropriate, CBDC could be a way to promote innovation in the NPS and enhance efficiency. Issuance of CBDC is not a full replacement of physical cash or private-sector money, including new digital currencies. All these forms of money can coexist. This coexistence would require a level playing field aimed at ensuring that competition is open and fair,  interoperability essential for an environment that needs to be open to innovation.

From our of [Mama Samia Institute](mama_samia_institute/intro.md) we would like to contribute to the required policies and research to find the right path forward.

The TSIP digital backbone project as suggested in this document implements the technical requirements for this project linked to the capabilities of the digital twin technology. We believe that the TSIP approach is a novel way on how to integrate digital requirements for the future.
