# Unified Payment System

![](img/cbdc4.png)  

Tanzania has already implemented multiple digital payment systems and we believe that the TSIP digital backbone could be a good way to complement them with a unified backend system to allow even more efficiency and widespread usage.

TSIP Unified Payment System has some unique advantages which will complement the existing systems.

- offline payments (no internet needed)
- proof of authenticity (make sure the seller is authentic)
- one party payment device, ability to allow people to make payments even if only one of them has a smartphone or computer
- QR based payments in all safety, imagine people can make payments with nothing more than scanning a QR code from their phone in all safety 
- **Full automatic integration with tax revenue collection system.**
