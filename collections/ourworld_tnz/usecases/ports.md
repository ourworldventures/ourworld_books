A Port Management Information System is a system integrated with the Vessel Traffic Management for real time information of vessels movement in Port Area. 

An efficient Port Management System accomplishes the following:

- Tracking of all containers arriving and leaving the port
- Ensure optimal utilization of the resources
- Effectively lower turnaround and lay time 
- Ensure real-time availability of information on operations and movements

The Digital Backbone System is Unique for the integration with the OurWorld:

- all operations and movements are tracked on a blockchain which is super scalable, and allows fine-grain control over who can change and add data
- multi signature operations are possible to make sure that processes are secure and fraud can be avoided
- this system integrates with the OurWorld Dashboard making sure that the government has real time oversight on what is happening in the port
- all handling agents need to use digital advanced tools to help them organize their workloads
- unique fingerprint & identification systems are used to make sure that containers can be tracked as they go in the country and leave at one point in time
- existing port management systems can get integrated over time with the digital backbone to get a unified view (future)
