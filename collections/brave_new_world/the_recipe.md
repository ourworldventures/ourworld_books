# Our Recipe

![](img/recipe.png)  

Together we can make this digital dream happen; we need commitment, a good plan, and most importantly, a loyal team and a strong partnership:

* A government which is committed to make this work, and be different. Some companies and individuals might not want such a huge step forward. so we need to be ready to defend the project.
* A sense of urgency, time is against us, the time is now. The world is changing; now is the best time to reach for our dreams.
* Being different and being at the forefront means we need to dare being different. We can't continue to do what everyone else is doing. It clearly isn't working! As Einstein said, *“We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used to create them”*. 
* Put a structure in place from which all of this can be executed. 
* Be safe, don’t take unnecessary risks, don’t run before walking, go iterative but  from the ground up with a newly designed sovereign system, based not on hype but on proof.
* A solid committed team with all the necessary knowledge, drive and passion, and willing to put in their all to make it happen. We believe ThreeFold can step forward and make it happen.
