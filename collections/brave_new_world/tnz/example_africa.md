# Tanzania an Example For Africa For Digital Empowerment

![](img/example_africa.png)  

Together we are confident we can achieve this vision to create a leading digital backbone to empower the future of Zanzibar. An affordable, digitally secure and transparent backbone, and at a later stage, sustainable physical spaces and an incubation center powered by a decentralized internet infrastructure will support the development of a tech startup environment, provide for local training, education and youth empowerment facilities within Zanzibar. The combination of scalable virtual services and sustainably implemented physical spaces will attract foreign investment as well as provide a solid economic model for the country whilst empowering Zanzibar's citizens through job creation and increased economic activity. 

### Empowered Communities
With more women being connected to Tanzania’s new digital backbone, endless opportunities present themselves to Tanzania’s female population.  This allows them to equally participate in the economy and attain access to information to become more self-sufficient and independent leaders. The digital backbone also breaks down the barriers of distance and time, allowing residents of rural areas to participate in economic and civic life far beyond their geographic region. Communications made possible by this  technology eliminates the logistical constraints of regionally-based business models, allowing businesses in isolated areas to compete with their big-city counterparts. 

Expanded access to digital services generates major economic growth and rapid job creation. Higher speed connections accelerate business development by providing new opportunities for innovation, expansion, and e-commerce. Connected communities create wealth and opportunity by attracting businesses to their localities.

Advances in information and communications technology means that education is no longer confined to the classroom. Customized  educational tools allow for remote collaboration among fellow students on projects, videoconferences with teachers and real-time video exploration of faraway areas. It helps students in preparing to enter the 21st Century workforce.
