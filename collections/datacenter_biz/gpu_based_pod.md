# GPU Based Pods

![](img/sumlator_gpu_pods.png)

This is a simulation for 8 containers with 512 pods which can be used for GPU workloads.

Each node cost 8000 USD and has a lot of compute, storage capabilities. The nodes are submerged in liquid oil and as such more protected, need less power and will also last much longer.

The investment needed for this amount of pods is 65m USD, important is that this investment only needs to be done as customers come on board. The upfront is low, we can start with 1 container with e.g. 32 pods and grow from there, this benefits the risk profile and cash need.

The pricing used is more cost effective than prices as used on the market today, see the pricing sheet.
