# Mainland - Tanzania

Located in the middle of Lake Victoria, Lake Malawi and Lake Tanganyika, Tanzania has one of Africa's most fertile lands. The farm lands in Tanzania are significantly cheaper than the ones in Zanzibar. We aim to acquire a total of 5 million square meters of land in mainland Tanzania. This acquisition will be done in phases based on the priorities of the projects at the time.
