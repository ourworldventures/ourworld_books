# Become a co-founder in OurWorld Nomads

We are looking for co-founders in our project. We have been working on this for +3 years and have now access to beautiful properties at discounted prices.

## Our criteria are the following

- Safety is our primary concern
- Far away from any possible conflict 
- Experiences: we are not just creating places to be or to work
    - We want to create places where we can experience energy and natural beauty
- Good enough internet connectivity: it's not always good on those locations but it needs to be good enough
- Ability to get organic food or grow it ourselves
- Good value for money
- Places where digital nomads like to come

## Tokenized structure

To power OurWorld Digital Nomad, we will create a Digital Nomad Token (DNT) which will act as a proof of co-ownership â€“ providing token holders the following benefits:
- A seat in the OurWorld Digital Nomad governance system, overseeing the further developments of the community and its ecosystem
- Yield on future rental of properties and related infrastructure (energy, food, internet generation) 
- Preferential access to homes, events and retreats in all locations 
- Priority access to organic food reserves and to internet 
- Ability to reserve premises/locations for private events

We are in a unique position to make OurWorld Digital Nomad a success thanks to: 

- Access to the described lands at highly discounted market value
- A hybrid future-proof business model with multiple yield generation streams 
- Our global network of nomadic communities and entrepreneurs
- Access to world leading traveling agencies

Next steps: 
- Secure land and properties
- Launch DNT at pre-sale value ($1)
- Build a team of community-builders, farmers, etc. to move the project forward.
