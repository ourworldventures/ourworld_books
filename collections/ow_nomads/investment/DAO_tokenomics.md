# DAO

> TODO: link to "What is a DAO?" document

## Phase 1
Holding company in Dubai holds: 
- SPV in Zanzibar (in process of being setup)
- SPV in Egypt (holds land and 4 boats and an operational organization operating the boats)
- SPV in Tanzania
- SPV in Turkey

The idea is that everyone invests as a convertible loan. Conversion will be done to governance tokens once phase 2 is done, or returned over time as income is generated or more DAO tokens sold, in other words it's ok to stay in as loan and just get money back over time as well. 

## Phase 2
The local SPVs are not for profit and work and their management can only execute on directions as given by the DAO. Their role is to deal with the operations of the assets locally. The DAO of the parent organiation has 100% community managed governance, which means the DAO can accept proposal for change or grants. The members of the DAO then vote on the proposals. 


## Phase 2 Tokenization
