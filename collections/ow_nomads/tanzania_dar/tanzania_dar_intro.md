# The City of Peace

We have a unique opportunity to acquire 2 million square metres of beachfront land just south of Dar-es-Salaam and turn it into a new home for digital nomads. 

## Location

The plot is 30km south-east of Dar-es-Salaam. It provides a refuge for digital nomads who wish to be away from city life and a staging point for those who want to visit the famous Serengeti National Park or Ngorongoro Crater, Lake Manyara, Sealous Game Reserve and Zanzibar. However, it is not unreasonably far from the business hub of Dar-es-Salaam and the airport. 
- 75 min to Julius Nyerere International Airport
- 75 min to Dar-es-Salaam city centre

## Built-up Area

There are 32 hectares of built-up land in the plot, consisting of 10 bungalows with thatched roofs. These bungalows have Wi-Fi, TVs, living areas, safes,  tea & coffeemaking facilities and they all have terraces with ocean views.

This laid-back, rustic hotel is 2 km from Bakhresa Beach along the Indian Ocean. It's 14 km from the National Museum and House of Culture, and 18 km from Julius Nyerere International Airport.

There's a steakhouse, and a restaurant set in a garden. A lounge features a billiards table. An outdoor pool has views of the ocean. Other amenities consist of breakfast and parking.

> TODO: Is this referring to the Marriott or is this on the plot of land that we want to build?


## Non built-up Area

These 2,000,000 square metres of yet undeveloped land has unlimited potential to be designed as the ideal haven for digital nomads. Current expectations are that around 100 rooms will be created, massively increasing the value of the property.
