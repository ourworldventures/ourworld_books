# Turkey Yenice Valley
The concept of Yenice Valle grew from a love of traditional Turkish village life and the desire to sustain our natural environment.

Yenice Valley has come to reality in a quiet and secluded valley, surrounded by tree-covered mountains, with accommodation built using traditional local materials. It includes a treehouse, stone cottages, and a log cabin, each in plenty of space, well-furnished and fully equipped. 

The focal point is a stunning stone-built boutique hotel, which is harmoniously nestled into the surrounding countryside. The valley is surrounded by an abundance of trees including pine, almond, olives and fruit trees, all of which attract a wonderful range of wildlife including birds, boars, squirrels, hares, tortoises and goats. Hiding away in the valley gives everyone a wonderful opportunity to experience nature at its best.  Waking up to the sound of bird song, peaceful evenings on the verandas and exploring the amazing countryside whether on foot or by car provide the perfect sanctuary.
