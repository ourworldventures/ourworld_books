# OurWorld Nomads
More and more people are choosing to embrace a location-independent, technology-enabled lifestyle that allows them to travel and work remotely. They are called digital nomads, and the trend is becoming more widespread.

It’s increasingly important for workers to be location independent, allowing them to live anywhere. Employers are listening as companies such as Lift, Airbnb and others have switched to permanent flexible work models. Countries such as the Netherlands also released a ‘flexible work act’ allowing people to request up-to 6 months of remote work annually. 

Countries such as Germany, Estonia, Dubai or Mauritius have started issuing digital nomad visas, permitting digital nomads to live and work in the country for a longer period of time than a tourist visa. Nomad visas have experienced a +2000% increase over the past 5 years. 

Digital nomads have no fixed residence and choose exciting locations as temporary residences while they work remotely. The choice of where to go usually depends on a lot of factors such as but not limitied safety, convenience, expenses and social life. The proposed Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) aims to form a co-ownership structure for existing and planned real estate developments that can appeal to digital nomads. The number of digital nomads have increased exponentially in the last years making the industry really valuable. The infographic below shows some statistics about the growing trend of living as a digital nomad.

## Unique co-ownership structure of a diverse real-estate portfolio
The initial investment portfolio in the planned co-ownership structure features real estate developments and assets of various kinds in safe locations across the world. The different kinds of assets that the DAO will hold include buildings, boats, equipment and farmlands located in the Zanzibar archipelago, mainland Tanzania, Dubai, Egypt and Turkey. There are a total of 6 locations planned for co-living/working environments designed according to the needs of digital nomads. There are also many farming locations in Tanzania, which provides a diversified investment portfolio while helping us learn how to feed our communities with locally grown organic foods. 

## Convenience for digital nomads
This project provides a lot of convenient accomodation options for the digital nomad community. A participating digital nomad will be able to choose a place to live and work from the different properties owned by the DAO. The processes for digital nomads to live in the premises can be streamlined and incentivized by tokenomics of the DAO. Visitors can move between different locations and still benefit from the established and trusted standards of living. The appealing locations of the assets and customized experience for digital nomads will ensure continued demand on the assets by digital nomads. 

Then sustainability of operations of the assets are a priority. Many of the identified assets feature sustainable living options such as the boats in the Nile having electricty generation from installed solar panels, planned carbon-negative developments in Tanzania, and eco-living development in Turkey. All locations will strive to grow their food locally to provide organic food supply that meets the expectations of the resident digital nomad community.
