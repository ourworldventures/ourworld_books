The community owned DAO will start acquiring real estate in the planned order of priorty, which might later change based on the opinions of the community. As more value is added to the DAO, the real estate portfolio of the DAO will get larger and all members will be the co-owners of the assets. The treasury of the DAO will increase in value over time thanks to the income from the assets. The DAO will then be able to make further additions to the asset portfolio, growing the value of the shares of all members.

OurWorld digital nomad believes in:

- Regeneration (Ultra-comfortable spaces, organic food and healing activities, e.g. yoga )
- Connection (Everything is designed to provide intimacy and bring people together) 
- Experience (Supportive environment that meets people’s personal and professional needs) 

We believe that more than just digital nomads, people are increasingly moving back towards community.  The current systems do not fit the human spirit, and people are waking up to it. 
To support the regenerative, inclusive and sovereign aspects of  OurWorld digital nomad, our properties are built around the following principles: 

- Conscious living in sustainable structures 
- 100% self-sovereign in regards to  food, energy production, internet infrastructure etc. 
- Regenerative organic farming is part of the business model to provide quality food to our residents and staff. 
- Working with local communities that tackle ESG concerns.
- Networking events and retreats to support community building and ecosystem growth.
- Co-working spaces (high internet speeds, access to best local sim-cards, community building sessions and tools, etc)
- Nomad Experience (full access to regional activities – cultural, nature, sports, networking, etc)
