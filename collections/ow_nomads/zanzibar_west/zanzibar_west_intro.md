# Zanzibar West - JP

Jungle Paradise is based at Mbweni in Zanzibar and is home to a super nice boutique hotel, botanical gardens and ruins with a rich history.

The location was instrumental in the abolishment of slavery in Zanzibar and had a school where slave children had a chance to get educated and become free.

Mbweni was a Universities Mission to Central Africa (UMCA) base and settlement for former slaves in the 19th century. The ruins of St Mary’s School for Girls, built by missionaries for girls freed from slave ships, is now set amid the lush gardens of Mbweni Ruins.

The Historic Ruins of the Mbweni School for freed slaves was founded in 1874, with associations with Sir John Kirk, Zanzibar’s first scientific botanist.

### Mbweni Gardens

The ruins are surrounded by a beautiful botanic garden which supports over 600 different kinds of tree species. Many mature trees that were propagated from the original garden of Kirk, which is now the nearby residence of the former Zanzibar President Amani Abeid Karume.

It has a mature rainforest atmosphere, only found in a few other places in Zanzibar and Pemba. It has many areas of native plants, including the coral rag forest on the cliff and mangroves on the shoreline.
