## Direct Investors in Mama Samia Institute

Together we fundraise 50m USD in Mama Samia Institute. We give out 20% of the shares of MSI to investors.

The investors get following benefits

* Preferential co-investment rights, they can invest upto 10x their investment into startups coming out of MSI. Example if an investor invests 2m USD in MSI, they can invest 20m USD in the startups coming out of MSI. The startups from MSI give absolute preferential rights to these investors
* Investors in the startups of the MSI always get liquidation preference on their investments, which means in case a startup has a less big exit as expected, they get their money back first
* Investors get Tax exemption on capital gains on their investment in the Institute as well as in the startups of the Institute (using their co-investment rights)
* Investors get preferential right to commercialize the products and services as offered by these startups
* They can leverage the knowledge and research capabilities of MSI for their own companies without having to pay for it. All knowledge is available to them. Regular training sessions will be organized which are available for employees of the investor
* They get a return on their investment as the Institute grows, the shares will be made liquid by means of a regulated Security Token Offering.

This 50m USD will be a required first step to get us going.

## Grants

MSI will create a department of talented people who know how to apply for grants and get money in a safe (not debt based) way without sacrificing any of our policies as defined in NWCP and ISP.

We expect to be able to mobilize +50m USD of grants per year within a couple of years.

## Sponsoring from partners.

* The institute is looking for sponsors
* The institute grows knowledge and opportunities for its ecosystem
* The institute will provide valuable knowledge to every company or organization in Tanzania and around
* The institute would be very happy to share this knowledge to any sponsor free of charge
* One of the key question the institute tries to answer is how can organizations be more effective with collaboration, IT systems, security, cloud and tools. Being effective in a highly dynamic environment is important, this is super valuable information which can benefit all participants
* This information will be free of charge and training sessions / seminars will be created to allow the Samia Institute Sponsors to create value for their own communities
* The help from the sponsors is highly appreciated and will also be mentioned on the website of the institute


## Exits

The institute will get meaningful exits which means serious cash will come because of exits. Kristof and Incubaid are willing to donate shares of their startups to MSI which might be worth hundreds of millions within 5 years.

New startups will also generate exits and liquidity, these proceeds can be used to further grow the Institute.

Next to the financial gain, these exits will be PR wise very important for our country.

## Margin/Revenue Sharing Opportunities

Often MSI will be able to participate in margin or revenue share of projects the startups deliver.
