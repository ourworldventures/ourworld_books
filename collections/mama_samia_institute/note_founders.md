# A personal note from the founders:

We believe the planet is a beautiful place, we believe the super large majority of people do mean well. But many of us live in fear and that holds us back. Basic needs are often not covered, this will remain challenging but providing regenerative tools might help.

The internet and new technologies can be an incredible tool to bring wealth to large amounts of people but today this is not the case. Very few (internet companies) have the benefit of us all. 

The internet used to be an incredible invention and place, we lost this, we want to help restore the internet to its original glory and deliver it as a tool for humanity to create on.

Our personal passion is to deliver a system which allows us all to co-create our future and work together rather than having to compete and fight for survival. We had incredible mentors who showed us some of the pieces required for which we are very grateful.

We believe the world needs more female energy and through youth and women empowerment big change can be achieved in a more sustainable way.

We spend all our time trying to help where we can and let this vision come alive.

We personally feel more at home in emerging countries compared to the more developed regions, there seems to be more possibility for creation and often people more easily find the path to their hearts. Real emotions are what drives us all.


# The Link To Tanzania

We as founders are looking for a place where we can recreate and provide real value by means of gifting our skills and time and knowledge to a meaningful set of projects.

* Tanzania was the birthplace of humanity long ago.
* Zanzibar was instrumental in abolishing slavery.

How meaningful is it that we can bring real freedom back to the world starting from this place.

Personally, I have enough, I donâ€™t like where places like Europe are going to, an alternative is needed. Most "none emerging" countries today are stuck and nothing can be realized. 

I personally believe Tanzania is so much more powerful and valuable than the average citizen believes. We feel the urge to help Tanzania to protect its resources and create their own independent future as much as possible without being taken advantage of.

We are looking forward to a real chance to make a change for the benefit of the country we call our new home for ourselves and our close communities.

We are looking forward for a chance to show that other values can be used to create prosperity:

    <td>GOOD = Heart Driven</td>
    <td>BAD = Fear Driven</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Purpose, money as a gift.</td>
    <td>Profit, money as a drug.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Give First, Receive Later</td>
    <td>Take first, maybe Give Back Later.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The power is within us. We need to choose that we have a choice, we are not powerless.</td>
    <td>Stardom, we need heroes, we want what they achieved, we hope for happyness that way.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Respect for the planet & people around us.</td>
    <td>We need to grab what we can.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Collaborate.</td>
    <td>Survival of the fittest.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Sustainability.</td>
    <td>Unhealthy drive for over optimization=efficiency.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Empowering & Transparency.</td>
    <td>Controlling and Secrecy.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


Of course we understand it's not always easy to achieve the above in the current world situation but we believe we have a real chance to use the technology we have available to be much more aligned with the above table.


Friendly planet positive regards
