# VALUES and PRINCIPLES

What beliefs and principles should be respected and exercised to achieve our vision?

- **Equality** 
    - We believe that everyone should be given equal chances to learn, partake and succeed. Internet access is a human right, we commit to scale our technology to new regions to empower the unconnected. 
- **Autonomy** 
    - We believe that everyone should own their data, and no one else. Our regenerative Peer-to-Peer technology allows every user to be data sovereign in line with their country requirements-  giving them control over their data providing a safety net..
- **Regeneration** 
    - We unify our practices, partnerships, and products around a single mission - to heal our planet. By making our technology actionable, we enable a collective approach to have an impact together.

## How is the Mama Samia Institute Different

### Female Energy is a must !

Current world has become too male and materialistic. Female nurturing energy is a requirement. This has nothing to do with gender, but with energy required to birth change for a world who needs it badly.

### No survival of the fittest

Rather than competition every member of the tribe helps their family to achieve required results to the benefit of the tribe. Collaboration over competition.

### Value Based Approach

Values are not marketing, they are the basis for our operation, one of our gating factors to decide if we support a startup or not is to assess the team capability to live and adopt a set of values.

Respect for the planet and their peers is the basis of all.

### Unique Collaboration System

20+ years of experience have taught us how to structure collaboration, a pyramid role based system is not effective and often not in line with the value system we believe in.
