# 10 YEARS IS TOO LONG, WE NEED TO GO FASTER

There are many projects out there which are looking forward to over 10, 20 or even 30 years. We believe this is too slow, we need change now.

We have all it takes to start now, let's hit the ground running.

Don’t talk, act, is our motto. Through decentralization faster change can be achieved.

### Startup Phase

* Sign concrete MOU 
* Fundraise (50m) and get necessary structure setup
* Finalization of the plan, required budgets, strategic alignment, etc.
* Establish ThreeFold Tanzania as basis for Internet Expansion
* Deploy first internet capacity on the ground as proof of concept

### year 1 plan

* Institute established and funded
    * Start from Technical University DAR
* Deploy POC’s for the initial projects, get PR coverage
* Establish teams
    * PR Team (public relations, promotion, global coverage)
    * Grants Team (find funding through grants)
    * Innovation Team
    * Create Policy Teams
* First 5 projects up and running
* ThreeFold project funded for Tanzania use case, deploy internet capacity with partners
    * For this a PPP structure is probably easiest
* Work with local ecosystem to grow the grid:
* 10.000+ students take part of our climate change project
 This can also provides access to free education and internet systems.

### year 2 plan

* Work with local ecosystem to grow the grid:
    * At least 10.000 nodes installed
* 100.000+ students enabled with climate change projects 
    * Meaningful measurable climate change impact (demonstrated & visual)
Carbon credit generation
* KILIMANJARO Project
    * +60% of our digital life needs available on the ThreeFold Grid in Tanzania
(this is huge, it is the alternative system, with all respect for planet & country)
* Institute Working
    * 10 projects in Incubator up and running, network effects have effect.
    * Lots more funding from abroad for the Institute.
* Concrete proof points show how
    * Mama Energy and Youth Focus does make a difference in providing more sustainable solutions, this needs to be measurable and demonstrable.

### year 3 plan

* Large majority of population has access to this new sovereign internet system
* Majority of our digital life needs available on the ThreeFold Grid in Tanzania (experiences)
* Large majority of schools know about the climate change projects, and education opportunities on this new internet
* First Mama Energy enabled startups to get to larger value and potentially exits
* Some first exits show the value potential of what the incubator is creating.
