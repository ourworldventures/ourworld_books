# WHY

![image alt text](img/for_humanity_planet.png)

The world has become a harsh place. Climate change is real. Economic systems seem to be on the verge of collapse. Many young people are losing hope. Everything seems to be based on survival of the fittest, still today we are all together wasting mother earthâ€™s resources in favor of personal gain. This can and needs to change.

We believe emerging countries have an important role to play, they might have the will and power to leapfrog into a powerful digital ecosystem future. Many "so called" developed regions are stuck in the creations of their past. Their effort goes into trying not to lose what they have achieved. We believe this will not work. We need change, and change needs to happen now. This is for the future of our children. 

We made mother earth sick. Let's empower our youth, let's say no to the constant brainwashing of the current internet and media systems. Our young friends need to be free in their mind, non manipulated, to be able to make decisions based on hope, respect and love, not based on fear. 

Technology could be a solution but often these projects have been created to the benefit of the founders and their investors rather than the planet (look at most blockchain projects, which might have started with good intentions but many of them are no more than cleverly masked pyramid schemes making a few people rich). 

Who are we to write these heavy words? Our team is here to make a difference, we have serious experience and want to put everything to work what we have achieved over the last 30 years to the benefit of the future generations, we choose to be at the service of emerging countries who mean well. We have the will, experience and drive to make it happen.

**We believe that youth and specifically women can be the driver of much needed change where respect for nature and the endorsement of country communities will prevail.**
