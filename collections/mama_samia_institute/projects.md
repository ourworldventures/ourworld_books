## ThreeFold

50m USD has been spent to create technology for a new internet, all has been done, the roll out is happening. We are willing to donate 20% of the shares of Threefold to Mama Samia Institute.

We are looking for ways to move the HQ from ThreeFold to ZNZ or TNZ.

ThreeFold will be valued +500m USD in the near future, and billions not much later, let's use this opportunity to make healthy PR for Tanzania and Zanzibar as a possible safe technology hub.

We can deliver a full blown internet experience for less than 1 USD per person per month.

ThreeFold would be 25% owned by MSI, initial investment from MSI = 5m USD for 5%, the other 20% has been donated by Kristof to the Mama Samia Institute.

## OurLedger

Tanzania or Zanzibar does not need an American or Chinese blockchain as the base for its future digital currencies or for other blockchain requirements. We suggest to create a new company at least 51% owned by MSI which will deliver blockchain technology to TNZ, ZNZ and around. The technology delivered will be truly fully decentralized, with blockchain nodes in the region and with no backdoors. The sourcecode will be available and a lot of attention will go to make sure that the countries who use this blockchain technology have met their requirements without losing their sovereignity. This blockchain can be used for digital currencies even for a Central Bank Powered Currency, digital identity, land ownership, etc. All knowledge and technology will be available in the country.

Incubaid and Threefold will provide all required knowledge and technology.

OurVerse would be 51% owned by MSI, initial investment from MSI = 2m USD.

The CyberPandemic is a reality, we have developed a real antidote for this problem. Security is becoming a major concern for governments.  OmniSphere's purpose is to commercialize solutions based on ThreeFold and some other based on Incubaid startups technology for helping governments, banks and enterprises, to beat this CyberPandmic Virus with a real antidote.
