# Natural Wealth Conservation Policies (NWCP)

![](img/natural_wealth_policies.png)  

Tanzania is one of the richest countries in the world in relation to natural resources. TNZ literally sits on a goldmine. Mama Samia Institute wants to help create and research policies which can help conserve wealth and come up with strategies which allows collaboration with other nations in a sustainable way without sacrificing natural wealth. Mama Samia Institute would like to offer this research and suggestions to relevant ministries and other government instances.

### Some ideas

* Foundations without shareholders are a practical way how land or mines can be owned without handing over control and too much of the profit to external shareholders. 

* Technology can resolve a lot. Practical satellite technology, blockchain and DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) mechanisms can be used to make sure that there is a fair contribution in the country. 

* Rather than using debt based instruments, shariah compliant investment mechanisms are more safe to protect the wealth of TNZ and ZNZ.

### How can this be done

* MSI will organize educational sessions for the government together with global experts to make sure that enough knowledge is available. All of these sessions will be recorded and written down and made available in Swahili and English to everyone in the country.

* Attract grants (not loans) from outside of the country to fund a large part of this work and hire required talent.

* Help universities to introduce some new educational content and courses in relation to Natural Wealth Conservation and its potential for the nation of Tanzania.

* Research and suggest some policies to make it happen.
