## Some 100% owned startups

We would like to create some startups which are 100% owned by MSI and as such generate profit for MSI.

Two examples who will require some more explanation

* CBDC = Central Bank Digital Currency for TNZ/ZNZ
* Gold (maybe Tanzanite or other materials) Token based financing and mining
* Carbon credit farming & exchange platform

Example about the carbon credit farming projects: it is very beneficial for Tanzania as well as to the investors who might want to invest in such a startup. These carbon credits would be digitized by blockchain technology as provided by ThreeFold and the Mama Samia Institute. We want to fundraise money for a carbon farming startup in Tanzania with massive ICV (In Country Value), Protecting land and farming carbon credits are a possibility today providing good for everyone involved. For this project, we work with Take Action Global who will be an integral part of our Institute, see [https://www.takeactionglobal.org/](https://www.takeactionglobal.org/). They have very concrete and well working programs to enable youth through education to deliver on the promise of climate change and provide concrete benefits for them and their families.
