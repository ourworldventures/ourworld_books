A beautiful value based Incubator concept with the purpose of helping Tanzania bring sustainable digital economic growth in harmony with nature, local population and government requirements. 

The Digitization of Tanzania is inevitable, we have a chance to make it a home grown digitization that considers the values, culture and actual needs of Tanzania rather than importing solutions that are often dependent on external parties that forces the assimilation of Tanzania to foreign requirements. The home grown digitization will unlock the potential of the Tanzanian economy. 

We have a unique chance to use digital technology to advance a country's future with full sovereignty and independence.

Young people need actionable hope in the current global climate, it's often hard for them and their future often looks grim. Our future generations need hope and a practical way forward. The Mama Samia Institute wants to be the home for thousands of young people, helping them to create their own regenerative future which can have an impact on millions of people globally. 

We do this by using advanced but sustainable technology concepts as well as a value based approach. We are not talkers, we are doers.
