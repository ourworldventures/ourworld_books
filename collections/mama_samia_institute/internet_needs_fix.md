# ONE OF OUR FIRST PROJECTS: "THE INTERNET NEEDS A FIX"

![image alt text](img/header.png)

The Internet is one of mankind’s greatest achievements. More than ever, it is playing a crucial role in our evolution to the point that internet access has become a human right. However, still today more than 3 billion people have no access to the internet, especially in developing countries. That is because the current internet infrastructure consists of hyper-scale data centers that are extremely costly and hard to deploy.

Still, over 1 billion people and 70 billion devices are expected to join the digital economy by 2025. Digital inclusion as well as the emergence of Edge Computing, Blockchain, Big Data and the Internet of Things requires Internet capacity to expand well beyond its current limitations.

Today, there are only two options available: to build power-hungry, hyper-scale data centers that cost billions (if not trillion) of dollars and require expert maintenance and sales teams; or to give up on data ownership and outsource infrastructure requirements to the tech giants that already own the majority of all Internet infrastructure and networks today.

Net neutrality is at stake and humanity deserves a better alternative than a centralized and unsustainable system benefiting a handful of companies that turn people into products.

Powered by our open source technology, we have created an open, autonomous and regenerative Internet infrastructure that can scale limitlessly. It flips the current centralized model upside down, and allows anyone to join the world’s largest and fastest growing economy in the world - the Internet and cloud economy.
