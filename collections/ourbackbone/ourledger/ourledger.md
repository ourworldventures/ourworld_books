This is a very important element of the full concept, it allows a community to self organize using digital technologies like digital twin as well as blockchain.

- Implement OurWorld education system where every citizen can participate as teacher and/or student, serves as example for country and/or world.
- Implement a digital health system which can unlock primary health care to everyone at a much lower cost using means available by the citizens already (knowledge, herbs, best practices, generic medicine, …)
- Implement a OurWorld governance system which is also an antidote against the cyber pandemic.

## The Concept

![](img/processes1.png)  

There is one system which is organized in layers to make it super easy to change for future requirements.

We implement it like this because our system needs to be the alternative to the [painkiller](../brave_new_world/no_pain_killer.md) approach.


There are 3 layers, each layer allows for easy abstraction, this backbone can be used for all required functions.
