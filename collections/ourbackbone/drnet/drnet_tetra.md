# WHY THREEFOLD TETRA

![](../issues/img/centralized_digital_backbone.png)

TETRA is a standard for ultra reliable communication networks, ThreeFold is complementing the communication standard with integrated Data and Compute capabilities using our ultra secure Zero-OS system.

ThreeFold TETRA equipment lasts. Investments in infrastructure easily cover 10-15 years in the core and even longer for base stations. Devices have been shown to have a typical lifespan of 7-10 years in the field. Users, operators and investors rely on the very well documented standard, constantly being maintained, evolved and improved by ETSI.

ThreeFold TETRA has been developed from the bottom up to meet the needs of critical users. 

ThreeFold TETRA provides multi-vendor choice â€“ allowing customers to switch from one supplier to another without sacrificing the multitude of functions and features ThreeFold TETRA provides.

Control room vendors have their systems tightly integrated with ThreeFold TETRA networks, and many users have optimised operational processes around the flexible capabilities of ThreeFold TETRA.

We at ThreeFold have partnered with TETRA standards to extend our Critical Operations network approach.
