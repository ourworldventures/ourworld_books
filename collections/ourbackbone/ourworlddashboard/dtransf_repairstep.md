![](img/future_digital_transformation.png)  

Its not enough to have all information available to the government or any other operational entity, it is as important that these organisations can give real time feedback and make sure that impact happens in the field when required.

We call this a positive feedback loop, the aim is to make change in a way that the full system experiences improvements in its flows and output.
