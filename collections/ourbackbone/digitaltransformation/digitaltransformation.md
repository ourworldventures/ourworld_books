## What is Digital Transformation?

Digital transformation is the integration of digital technology into all areas of a nation, fundamentally changing how you operate and interact with your citizens, corporations and other nations. It's also a cultural change that requires Tanzania to continually challenge the status quo, experiment, and get comfortable with failure.

Digital transformation has so many possible interpretations and facets, extending from going paperless, to integrating machine learning and AI into your systems. Therefore, Tanzania need to make sure that it has a coherent and effective plan for how it will digitally transform and establish itself as a leader in tech and sustainability in Africa.

## Why is Digital Transformation so important?

National governments are the stewards of their digital agendas, leading cross-sectoral directions of growth, investment and coordination. In adopting digital transformation as a government policy, Tanzania will inspire the digitization of all elements of Tanzanian society. This  national harmonization around shared policies, platforms, and peer learning, encouraged by a strong approach to digital transformation, will magnify Tanzania's ability to realise its goals.

Digital Transformation is so important because it will help make Tanzania a global leader in the following ideals.
- Sustainability
- Sovereignty
- Efficiency

### Sustainability

Digital Transformation allows Tanzania to hold all its citizens and foreign influences to account over their environmental practices. No longer will big multinationals be able to abuse their influence and dump their externalities onto the people of Zanzibar. Moreover, such transformation will encourage both the learning of exciting new technologies from around the world, but create the environment necessary, within Tanzania, for a thriving and innovative sustainable tech community.

### Sovereignty

The Digital Transformation of Tanzania will allow it to reclaim control over its data. In the status quo, the majority of data in Zanzibar is processed and stored by Europe and the US. Not only does this present huge issues in terms of sustainability and efficiency, but it also means that Tanzania's citizens don't truly own their data. 

### Efficiency

Tanzania will also be able to streamline many processes, both at a governmental and corporate level, freeing up valuable resources for exciting new projects and developments.
