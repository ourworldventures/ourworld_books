No matter the size of your business, a successful digital transformation strategy begins with the leadership team having a clear understanding and vision of what the business is transforming into, experts agreed.

As businesses continue to pursue their transformation initiatives, accelerated over the past year by the COVID-19 pandemic, it is essential they avoid the missteps that can lead to failure. This overview of the six key reasons why organizations encounter digital transformation failures — and advice on how your organization can avoid these hurdles — will help your teams build a digital transformation roadmap that brings business value.

### Lacking the correct mindset

Not having the right transformation mindset is often the first reason why digital transformation initiatives can either regress, underperform or fail outright, according to Gartner’s Moyer. People are naturally averse to change, but our transformation leaders can play a pivotal role in helping bring about the mindset change required for successful transformations, she added.

“Our leaders really need to get behind the transformation. They need to set the tone, they need to model the behaviors for transformation and then they need to operationalize those behaviors,” Moyer said.

Another mindset that drives digital transformation failures is when the rest of the organization views IT as a “necessary evil”/ Leaders who act as an engine for change and education — instead of just being execution partners — and have the executive buy-in from the very beginning will be successful in establishing IT as a transformation enabler.

###  Not having the right culture

An organization’s inherent culture can make or break an organization’s transformation initiatives. Culture change is at the heart of digital transformation, and existing cultures that are going to be more successful with digital transformation are going to be those that embrace change and collaboration.

That’s because, regardless of whether it’s changing products, internal operations or how a company engages with customers, digital transformation always involves getting different departments and different groups within departments to work together in a more coherent and effective way.

“If you don’t have a culture of collaboration across the different functions, across different divisions, the transformation is really going to fail,” Eggplant’s Edwards said.

Change management is a key component in bringing about successful culture change; effective change management can identify people who are most resistant to change and then provide them with the right training and education to turn them into digital transformation champions.

### Not having the right talent

Unavailability of appropriate talent to drive transformation initiatives is another factor why digital transformation failures happen.

By finding people with the right skills for your digital transformation team can be a challenge. So much so, that even the pandemic-induced unemployment rate hasn’t loosened up the talent market, Moyer said. There’s still a dearth of talent in high-demand fields like artificial intelligence and cybersecurity.

Devin Redmond, co-founder and CEO of Theta Lake, advised companies to hire people who are aware of what can go wrong with such initiatives and can actually impart that knowledge to the rest of the organization. These change agents can help create the right focus, business processes and training procedures needed for success.


### Lack of clear goals

Governments need to understand what the key areas of focus are and what they are trying to achieve from the business point of view — be it reducing costs, or being more agile or being more secure

Not defining clear goals means your project will end up with people going in lots of different directions; there will be no alignment and, eventually, it will lead to failure, Edwards reinforced.

Like any change initiative, the number one thing is just to make sure you have got your goals defined properly and then defining initiatives that actually deliver those goals.

Doing technology for the sake of technology has always been a bad idea.


### Failing to think through the required technology

When implementing digital transformation projects, focusing solely on the enabling technology of a subarea can lead to failure.

Say, for example, a business in a highly regulated industry is looking at enabling a video-first communication environment. If it only focuses on how a tool like Zoom or WebEx can improve employee communication and fails to consider the compliance implications of the new software, the project will get held up, Redmond said.

Everyone should be doing that research in advance to say, ‘OK, I should be looking at the full stack of technology if I’m going to be sharing information in a new way, and I need to have new security and compliance infrastructure in place, and I need to involve those other constituencies,'”
