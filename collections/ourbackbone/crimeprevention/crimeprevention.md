# Crime Prevention

![](img/crimeprevention.png)  

Financial crime is a threat to all of society, and it constantly seeks new ways to exploit banks and bank customers. This is why crime prevention is a vital part of our business. Although there are no perfect systems, we work relentlessly to strengthen our defenses and develop our abilities to detect, prevent and report suspected activity. Every year we report thousands of suspicious transactions to authorities and we cooperate closely with authorities, police and other banks.

## Money laundering (AML)

Money laundering is the illegal process of criminals trying to make funds made from unlawful activity seem to have been generated legitimately. This poses a threat not just to banks, but to the entire financial system, democracy and society as a whole. Our immutable blockchain ledger will ensure that all assets can be tracked to their source.

## Cyber attacks

Digitalisation is affecting every aspect of banking. Stability and reliability of the bankâ€™s IT platform is therefore crucial. Interruptions or any kind of breaches into the systems can cause major problems, both for customers, suppliers and employees. 

## Strong identity management

Identity fraud is a very common cybercrime, with americans losing $52 billion last year to identity thieves. We use innovative authentication mechanisms based in blockchain technology and integrated with KYC/AML procedures to provide a gold standard of identity management and protection.

## Market abuse and insider dealing

This is very difficult in our system because everything is transparent and on blockchain.

## Terrorist financing

Terrorists often control funds from a variety of sources around the world and employ increasingly sophisticated techniques to move these funds between jurisdictions. To manage their finances, they draw on the services of professionals, such as bankers, accountants and lawyers, and take advantage of a range of financial services products.

Our blockchain and transparency will make this particularly difficult for them.
