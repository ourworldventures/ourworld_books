## History and track record 

#### Wave One 

Our focus during Wave One was very IT-centric – around storage, automation and cloud. During this wave from 2000 till 2015 some of our companies defined parts of the cloud landscape, and are still being used actively today.

Throughout wave one, more than $500 million in exits was realised with less than $50 million investment.

Our team was involved in technologies like:
- OpenStack
- ZFS (the storage system)
- The first data dedupe system for backup in the world
- The first distributed storage system for large archive solutions
- The most used hypervisor in the world

#### Wave Two

Our beautiful world has turned into a crazy place that is changing rapidly – not all innovations are for the greater good. We are spearheading an incubator which is making real change and which has a purpose to resolve some of the biggest issues in the world. 

There is a lot of talk in the world, we believe the time for talking is over, we need action and we need it now, our planet is a super beautiful place, we don’t want to take it for granted, we want to fight for it. 

The Internet was a beautiful place 30 years ago, we want it back and we believe a better internet is an instrumental tool to make us free again, to allow us to all together create a better world for ourselves and our children. The internet is now owned by and benefits the few, rather than the many. We became a product in a capitalistic system – yet most of the world still holds humanistic values. It’s time to return the internet to the people. Will you join us?

It all started with a group of crazy people and “nerd” engineers, who decided to stop talking and just build a new system. We didn’t ask for permission, we didn’t do a crypto ICO with lots of promises, we started building. 

With the help of more than 80 investors and thousands of project supporters we have been able to build a lot and are working on even more:

- A new internet infrastructure platform (fully peer2peer and decentralized, and super reliable) = ThreeFold
- A new decentralized and regulated finance & digital asset exchange system, based on values (work in progress)
- A set of incredible experiences, with the ability to provide digital freedom for all our online requirements.
- An upgraded economic system platform where no money needs to be paid to offer or find information, where lock-in does not exist.
- A Digital Twin system which is the base of Banking and Web 4.0, a new way to communicate, share, collaborate
- A decentralized healthcare & education system

More than 50m USD has been invested so far, we have a very active community of hundreds of contributors and we are working with some governments to deploy the system in their country. We are excited about a future where we can together create a more safe platform, based on values, transparency and love. Not in a talking way, in a super practical can do mentality with concrete plan. We are doing it, join us… become part of our movement.

## Funding

The Incubator will be looking for additonal USD investment from max 10 Founding Partners (in total).

Each Partner will receive Sukuk certificates for their participation in the Incubator of the Institute. A Sukuk (Islamic bond or “Sharia-compliant” bond) is an Islamic financial certificate that represents a portion of ownership in a portfolio of eligible existing or future assets.
