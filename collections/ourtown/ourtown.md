# OurTown Sustainable Cyber City

![](img/residence1.png)  

We are building a carbon-neutral, mixed-use project in Zanzibar, the first of its kind. Our aim is to create a dynamic ecosystem of communities that drive economic growth and contribute to the diversification of the economy, while forging a nation-wide planet-first perspective. Core to our ethos is the concept of self-sufficiency. We believe that our sustainable city must uplift the many communities of Zanzibar, and be completely self-sufficient and sustainable.

OurTown believes in putting our planet first, people second and profits last. That’s the only model we believe can create real sustainable value. We aim to build this first blueprint in a way that nurtures breakthrough technologies while respecting Zanzibar’s cultural heritage and landscape. The blueprint builds on 7 integrated systems to support its ‘planet-human-centric’ vision: 

1. Zero-waste and circular systems – Community-led waste management systems for recycling and upcycling, waste water, composting, biogasification and more.

2. Carbon neutral energy systems –  A smart grid energy system with solar power as its primary source, and complemented with alternatives such as wind energy. 

3. Food safety – With innovative community-led urban agriculture and regenerative farmlands, OurTown aims to achieve complete food security for its people and local communities. 

4. Sustainable water systems – By applying a suite of sustainable methods; rainwater harvesting, smart faucets, and greywater recycling, we aim to minimize water coming in and out of OurTown.

5. Sovereign Internet infrastructure – A built-in decentralized edge datacenter model which produces sovereign internet and cloud capacity for both physical and digital residents. The infrastructure can host any IT workload and the excess capacity can be rented to the region.

6. Decentralized governance –  OurTown will be co-owned by its community members. The underlying internet infrastructure will support the autonomous, decentralized and transparent governance of all co-owned assets as well as future proposals for modifications to and developments of OurTown. 

7. Innovation incubator – OurTown will be established as a regulatory sandbox, empowering the city with a unique legal framework. This will attract global talent to our innovation center to further develop the blueprint of a self-sovereign, decentralized and sustainable community and to nurture other cutting-edge projects.

These interconnected systems will generate 100% of the operational energy of OurTown and help OurTown establish complete self-sufficiency. We aim to integrate these technologies into the built environment in innovative and harmonious ways to enhance community well-being.

The target market of the city include start-ups, digital nomads, eco-tourists, employees and families. The digital businesses in the city will have a focus on cyber security, internet, AI, green tech & IT, agritech, communication, software and gaming. The amenities within the city will serve the mentioned target market.
