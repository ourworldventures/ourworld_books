OurTown is located in Fumba on a 1 million square meters plot. The government has prepared a master plan of the region with the plot of OurTown reserved for development includng a business center, sport centers, medical center, university and many other facilities. The plot is 15 km from the airport and 18 km from Stone Town. Fumba is expected to be a developed region of Zanzibar after planned government investments in the area. This will attract anyone wanting to own a property in Fumba and Zanzibar in general. 

OurTown will be a catalyst in bringing together the strength of government with the entrepreneurship of the private sector. It will also foster innovation and collaboration by housing various digital businesses and talented individuals in one location within Zanzibar. As such, OurHub wll not stand on its own, and OurTown is an example in the world of how digital can be connected to physical space. With sustainability at the core of the project, OurTown sets an example for the future. Eventually millions of people can call this home while maybe physically few thousands of people will live there. OurTown is expected to attract local communities and other people around the world. There are frequent flights from the Middle East and Europe into Zanzibar.
