# World First 

We have plans and solutions to create a sustainable city that can fully sustain its needs for food, energy and core consumer products. Compared to conventional implementations of self-sufficiency, OurTown will have digital sovereignity and self-governance therough its own decentralized internet and digital backbone, facilitating communications, transactions and governance. OurTown will be the first ever development to achieve complete self-sufficinecy with sustainable living, digital sovereignty, and autonoous governance.

## Self-sufficiency

### Physical Self-Sufficiency: Sustainable Living
Through collaboration with one of the co-founders of Dubai Sustainable City, one of the first ever net-zero communities of its size, we will ensure that OurTown is sustainable and self-sufficient in terms of food, energy, water and waste. More than half of the land area is reserved for nature and recreational areas. These areas will contain regenerative farming and conservation zones that promote social engagement that will become a core element of the education of OurTown’s children. We are also obtaining a separate plot in the most fertile region of Zanzibar to supplement the city food supply and we are already in contact with local nature conservationists and regenerative farmers. 

Our team is currently working on ways to sustainably manage OurTown’s water supply, energy production, waste, mobility and air quality. We aim to integrate the solutions into the built environment in innovative and harmonious ways.

### Digital Self-Sufficiency: Digital Sovereignty 
OurTown citizens will have complete digital sovereignty through a decentralized internet infrastructure  installed in the city. This technology has already been developed and deployed by ThreeFold around the world. The network will consist of thousands of small nodes that generate compute, storage and network capacity, allowing citizens to store their data locally and to truly own it. All citizens will have secure digital twins that store their data, facilitate peer-2-peer communication and provide completely reliable identification. These twins will also provide applications for and solutions to all of its citizens' digital needs, from messaging and file storage to education, without involvement by third parties. 

### Governance Self-Sufficiency: Autonomous Governance
The strong digital identity management of OurTown unlocks many possibilities around autonomous governance. OurTown will be managed by a DAO involving all its members. Due to Digital Twin technology, the community-run DAO can accept proposals for changes/grants and easily/ and securely vote on them.

## Green technology

We are in contact with innovators and businesses that will help OurTown become an example self-sufficient and carbon-neutral development. The diagram below shows what technologies are planned for use in order to make the waste, material, energy, food and water processes more regenerative. Research and development on these technologies will attract talent and provide significant know-how to people in Zanzibar working on the project.

## OurTown holding balance 
The development of OurTown Sustainable City represents the political will to work towards a sustainable future. Commitment to regenerative practices will result in sustainable and equitable growth which will become an example for the rest of the world. The development will showcase how sustainable development can be achieved while reflecting the values of the local communities and their culture.

The integration of digital aspects of the development to the regenerative practices within it will make an incredible example of how emerging technologies can be used to foster sustainable development with the right policies. OurHub will make it convenient for innovators and businesses to come to the city to work on disruptive technologies. These innovators will be able to use OurTown as a physical or digital home. 
Imagine a sustainable city where the social needs of all are met while living in symbiosis with nature. Mother nature provides abundantly, but only if we treat her well. By keeping environemntal needs in mind, you are already creating a better future for your people. And when the needs of both the planet and the people are met, you open the door for successful and reliable economic development.
