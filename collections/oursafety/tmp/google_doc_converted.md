# OURSAFETY.IO

Is a Venture as created by OurWorld venture Builder ([see here ](https://threefold.docsend.com/view/eiuvm5pqtf277982)for more info about our venture builder program).


# Purpose

Allow everyone to experience a safer world without handing over sovereignty to foreign parties. 


# The Problem

There are quite some companies delivering security and surveillance technology services.

Some potential issues to think about



* Most Security Systems and/or Security Cameras have backdoors inside (often the vendors are not aware). 
* For cameras, it's too hard and impractical to store and process the large amounts of data as is being produced by the camera’s. The data needs to travel further away before it can be processed.
* Not enough real time actions.
    * See suspicious behavior right away
* Too Expensive
    * Cost of Storage
    * Cost or Processing
    * Cost of Equipment



**Security and Privacy can not be taken lightly**



* Often bugs or backdoors allow hackers to get access to cameras or other IOT devices, this is a breach of private data and in the worst case can be a serious issue for national security.
* How to protect secure and ultra private environments, imagine government buildings or meeting rooms, protection is needed but how to make sure that the surveillance can not be abused by hackers or other remote instances? 
* We are not only talking cameras, but same is true for
    * Televisions and certain projectors.
    * Printers (huge issue)
    * IP Telephones (conference phones)
    * Phone’s (of course people can keep phones out of secure areas)
    * Sometimes the security equipment itself e.g. firewalls itself is hacked and has backdoors.

How can you be sure that your vendor is really trustworthy?



* Often the vendors don’t even know themselves and unwillingly allow their customers to be vulnerable.

We are in a real cyber pandemic.



* Event electricity nets can and are used to transmit information and get commands from remote. Over the electricity net it's possible to communicate to devices which aren’t even connected to a wired or wireless network connection.
* Even our mobile phones can now re-transmit and make their own networks e.g. each iphone has a bluetooth based peer2peer wireless network which is used to find my phone, but it's also a network which can be used by hackers. Bluetooth or other small wireless transmitters e.g. LoRAN are a serious threat to nation security and almost not available. LoRAN can reach very far and allow people to transmit/send commands to your devices to e.g. do surveillance.
* A TV, Printer, Phone, Security Camera are all devices known to be used for remote hacking & surveillance.
* It's almost impossible right now for governments to protect themselves.


# Approach

We believe a completely different approach is needed around safety and security,ThreeFold wants to create ventures out of the ThreeFold Venture Builder which we call OURSAFETY.IO Ventures and are all focussed on specific operational areas. Our first area’s are Zanzibar and Tanzania because we already work very closely together with the government and the request for these services is there right now.

Each Venture is independently funded through a regulated Investment vehicle at start in ADGM the financial center of Abu Dhabi. 90% of the money will only be released once the PPP has been established and the company has been created. 10% is released immediately to finish the feasibility study, create the legal structure and get to conclusion with the government. 

The investment vehicle provides for good upside as well as strong downside protection by means of exit preference. \
The money in escrow during the startup phase will be kept in multiple currencies and gold.

We will start the process  to create the PPP (Public Private Partnership) with TNZ or ZNZ once we have initial 2m USD funded. 

What happens if for an unexpected reason the project would not happen? The investor gets the choice to use 100% of the proceeds for another project from the ThreeFold Venture Builder or can ask money back (the 90%). There are quite some other exciting projects happening.

You can also decide to invest in the ThreeFold Venture Builder itself and as such you would have a stake in each venture created and be at holding level. 


# OURSAFETY.IO PRODUCTS

OurSafety has exciting products which are the result of +10 years of engineering and are now ready for commercialization. The first system we plan to release is a camera surveillance system


## OurSafety Surveillance System v1 (Q2/Q3 2023)

Is a super unique camera & surveillance system with following unique benefits



* Backdoors have no chance. Sovereignty guaranteed.
    * <span style="text-decoration:underline;">All</span> code opensource and delivered to the operating party.
* Absolute best Security & Privacy
    * Code upgrades protected by blockchain.
    * Commands protected by blockchain.
    * Unique Operation System (close to hardware)
* Billing Integration (optional), to allow multiple parties to make money in ecosystem
* Green and Cost Effective. Can store much more high resolution 
* Can scale to country wide level easily
* Unique combination of services in 1 enclosure (see below)
* AI driven processing (face/plate recognition, …) 

Has the following components in 1 surveillance node (enclosure)



* Camera
    * high def, in line to requested quality (has influence on price)
* NetworkWall
    * there is no network connection possible between camera, compute and storage node and outside world), the Network Wall speaks a custom protocol over UDP and end2end heavily encrypted and protected by blockchain identification.
    * Even if there are backdoors left in e.g. camera, they can’t get outside.
* Quantum Safe Decentralized Storage System
    * using forward looking error correcting codes.
    * data is not stored on 1 device, data gets distributed to many nodes at once.
    * data can never be lost nor corrupted.
    * Even a Quantum Computer cannot hack because the storage information at any path is simply not complete to even try to hack or decode. There is not enough info to work with.
* Compute Node
    * optional, if local processing is required
    * Can real time detect suspicious behavior and report back to NOC.
    * Integrates seamlessly with the Network and Storage System
* Quantum Safe Decentralized Network System
    * Network is not following one path, get distributed over multiple paths at once.
    * Even a Quantum Computer cannot hack because the network information at any path is simply not complete to even try to hack or decode. There is not enough info to work with.
    * Ultra reliable, redundant, can use multiple physical paths (satelite, 4G/5G, fiber, wireless, …) all together ! 
* BlockChain
    * There is a custom blockchain inside, this allows very strong verification of commands and ultra resilient operation. Multisignature commands and upgrade paths are foreseen.


## 


## OurSafety EWall (end 2023)

This device is still in the research phase but we have developed similar devices in previous company's from our Venture Builder (company was called Racktivity).

This device cuts the network and electricity connection because both can relay signals and network information.

The EWall will also have very sensitive sensors to detect unwanted bluetooth, meshed wireless, loran and other unwanted communication signals. 



<p id="gdcalert2" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image2.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert3">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image2.png "image_tooltip")


If the EWALL detects suspicious behavior it will cut the network and electricity to protect people inside. \
The EWall will clean electricity to only have clean power with optional battery protection.

This device is an absolute must in high security sensitive places, the current devices are backdoored and it's just a matter of how much it costs to access them.

While the EWall may sound like a boring device but it's ultra important to secure safe environments to operate from. The world became a very unsafe place, the cyber pandemic is real.


## 


## OurSafety MWALL (end 2023)

A custom designed mobile device to protect your digital life when you are on the road.



<p id="gdcalert3" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image3.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert4">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image3.png "image_tooltip")


This mobile device is running Zero-OS and connects to the internet over WIFI or 4G/5G, it terminates all TCP/IP traffic. It runs our quantum safe network and storage system inside, this allows ultra safe data storage and communication to other components of the OurSafety ecosystem.

The person using the phone or computer connects to the ultra secure OHQ for secure Operations.

Phone’s today cannot be protected and it's almost impossible to do so, there are simply to many unsafe hardware and software components in everydays phones.

Our approach allows you to still use a normal phone (we recommend using a hardened phone though) but getting much more security.

We especially don’t trust iPhones and some of the modern android phones these days because of the hidden network functionality they have over peer2peer bluetooth. We are not claiming that apple cannot be trusted but even if they are ok, this is a huge opportunity for hackers create to create network connections into your phone even when it's powered off and not connected to a wireless of 4G connection, the only thing it needs is other bluetooth devices around which have this meshed bluetooth network functionality inside. It's only time before this techno finds it's way into televisions, printers, and other iOT devices.


## 


## OurSafety OHQ (2023)

OHQ stands for Operations Head Quarter.

The OHQ is installed in a HWALL, a HWALL = HydroWall is a liquid cooling environment for compute, we use infiniband or FPGA based communication between the computers in the HWall.



<p id="gdcalert4" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image4.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert5">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image4.png "image_tooltip")


A HWALL is safe for EMP attacks and will keep dust and humidity out. It will get hardware to live longer and be ultra stable. A HWALL is a system which submerses the compute and storage hardware in a safe liquid.

The OHQ is your secure environment in which you can connect with the rest of the world when needed, but most communication, collaboration stays inside the OHQ protected environment.

In OHQ the following services are available



* Messaging (chat and ultra secure email in sandboxed environments)
* Ultra Secure Document Collaboration (full MS office compatible)
* Secure Audio/Video Conferencing
* It is a strongly authenticated environment but supports anonymity while still being strongly authenticated.
* Full Secure Escalation & Project Management (ultra secure & private)
* Events Management (see what happens in the world)
* Flexible Dashboard & Monitoring System (give overview on operations)
* Knowledge Base & Secure eEducation system

The system is ultra secure, no documents or communication (messages) go out of the OHQ !!! 


# 


# OURSAFETY.IO TECHNOLOGY SPECIALS

Following components are 100% made available by ThreeFold to the OurSafety Venture and the result of more than 10 years of development. The components are now 3e generation and are used in the field on a global scale in the ThreeFold grid.


## Zero-OS



* ThreeFold has developed a unique operating system called Zero-OS which has no installation footprint and is fully managed and operated through blockchain technology.
* The Operating System has no shell or server interface.
* Zero-OS can be embedded and deeply integrated by available hardware.
* Zero-OS can even be integrated on the camera itself, to make sure it cannot be operated by unwanted teams and multisignature is available for sensitive operations like upgrades.


## TFChain



* A custom blockchain which operates all Zero-OS’es.
* Has also financial modules inside which allows monetization of the network.
* Smart Contract for IT allows secure operation of a network.


## Quantum Safe Storage System 



* A unique storage system where data can never be lost nor corrupted.
* Data can scale to zetabytes (thousands of petabytes)
* Quantum computers cannot hack it.
* And it's also a very green and cost effective system
* Optional: there is a billing model inside, the parties providing connectivity get paid for the service they offer.


## Network Wall



* This is not a firewall, it's a real Wall, no network traffic goes between the inside and the outside.
* The network wall speaks the outside protocols and will bring the data only without using TCP IP to the inside, this disconnects the inside systems completely.


## Planetary Network



* Is an overlay network, using other existing networks e.g. the current Internet.
* End2End encrypted.
* Look for the shortest path.
* Provides redundancy
* Integrated Billing if required.


## Quantum Safe Network System (NEW 2023)



* A unique concept where data is sent over multiple network paths as once and only when they get recombined at the destination the packets make sense again. Think about it like a letter is cut in 10 pieces, and send over 10 paths, every path can only see 1 of the 10 pieces which would make it hard to make sense out of the total. The algorithm we use is smarter, and makes sure that the data is meaningless and can not be reconstructed if not enough packets arrive.
* The network is able to have a certain amount of lost or corrupted packets, it would still allow reconstruction (redundancy), the technology used is called forward looking error correcting codes and is used in space for error detection.
* It can use multiple network paths 4G/3G/Wireless Peer2Peer/Fiber/Satelite … all at once.
* Optional: there is a billing model inside, the parties providing connectivity get paid for the service they offer.


## Quantum Safe Compute System (NEW 2023)



* This is optional and only required when compute safety requirements are ultra secure.
* The compute modules are put in liquid cooling and not connected over TCP/IP (the internet protocol).
* The compute modules communicate over InfiniBand or FPGA custom hardware network switches.
* It's a combination of physical safety (e.g. light sensor, cuts power, …) 
* It's also safe for EMP attack (Electromagnetic Pulse)


# OURSAFETY.IO COMMERCIAL MODEL

OURSAFETY.IO has two models to operate.


## Direct Model

The customer buys the services and products directly from OURSAFETY.IO. This is a very classic commercial approach. OURSAFETY.IO gets a return on a setup fee as well as a maintenance monthly or yearly fee.

It's worth to note that OURSAFETY.IO has a huge cost benefit compared to competitors e.g. our internal cost for quantum safe storage can be as low as 1 USD per TB per month. Market sales prices are 10-200 USD per TB per month. This shows how we can generate the most reliable and secure storage capacity at disruptive pricing.


## Sukuk Investment Model

OURSAFETY.IO gives out Sukuk certificates and finds investors for them.These Sukuk certificates are used to manufacture and acquire the components as discussed above.

The Sukuk holder gets a revenue share approach plus fixed return on the Sukuk Certificates and as such participates in the commercial model. 

The customer does not have to acquire or pre-invest but a revenue share model will be created.

Income is based on:



* Monthly Retainers
    * Monthly retainer for the utilization of the deployed network (all the devices together)
* Utility Based
    * amount of Network/Computer/Storage used
* User Based
    * For OHQ we operate a per user fee, which is between 20 and 100 USD per user per month depending on level of security and services. 
* Benefit Based
    * If Security Cameras give opportunities to charge from irregular behavior e.g. speeding, red light crossing, … a part of the penalty fee will be returned to the Sukuk holders as well as OURSAFETY.IO.


# OURSAFETY.IO IS A FOR PURPOSE ORGANIZATION

Example see  [https://purpose-economy.org/en/](https://purpose-economy.org/en/)

This means



* Specific share distribution (after 2 rounds)
    * 36% to investors
    * 30% for ThreeFold (the technology partner and provider)
    * 12.5% to benefit of the contributors (by means of a For Purpose Reward Pool)
    * 16.5% to benefit of ZNZ/TNZ Government
* All the cash generated keeps on being re-invested in the company,  \
this has the chance to create exponential value creation by constant re-investment.
* Exit for the investors is by means of 
    * Security Token Offering
    * Private (re)Sale of the shares
    * Buy back of the shares by the For Purpose Organization


# OURSAFETY.IO INVESTMENT & SHAREHOLDER TABLE

We are organizing a ROUND A investment round of 5m EUR, it's structured as a SAFE. Dubai Vigilance, an investment and asset recovery firm in ADGM, has the license to allow the creation of such a SAFE. Once the SAFE reaches 2m USD a company will be created and the SAFE will convert in shares of the new company. The investors of the SAFE instrument will have insight and voting rights on the construction of the company (location, modalities, …).

We are planning projects in Zanzibar and Tanzania, the investments are spread over the 2 projects, each project will focus on this area. 


## For Zanzibar



<p id="gdcalert5" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image5.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert6">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image5.png "image_tooltip")




* The shares will be tokenized in 2023 or 2024, and liquidity will be looked for
* Investors Round A have 1.5x liquidation preference (means they get their money back 1.5x before anyone)
* Valuation for our Round B unknown

There are already 1500 camera’s on the island and it needs to become much more, the Island is growing quite well. Also the government needs better security for their government operations.

There is a very good downside protection mechanism inside, if for whatever reason the company would not do well and a firesale would not return the wanted result the initial investors first get their money back 1.5 times their investment before any of the founders or other parties get benefit.


## For Tanzania

Tanzania is a big country (5x size france) with 60,000,000 citizens, Tanzania also wants to do commercial business with the countries around. This gives us access to +150m people through the government.

We structure this investment as a PPP (Public Private Partnership).



<p id="gdcalert6" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image6.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert7">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image6.png "image_tooltip")


We are planning 30m USD of revenue within 3 years for this project from which the majority will be recurring, this will lead to a serious valuation.


# OURSAFETY.IO ASSETS



* All required technology (provided by ThreeFold) = result of +6 years of development (50m USD invested)
* Starting Team with all required Knowledge


# PRACTICAL


## Use of Proceeds



* 1.5m USD for operational expansion (team, sales, product management, overhead, …)
* 2.5m USD further integration and engineering.
* 1m USD for logistics and pre-purchase of initial stock (components)


## Revenue

We are very confident to close projects very soon thanks to our relationships with the governments of TNZ and ZNZ. Thanks to their shareholding we are a PPP (Public Private Partnership) and no tenders are needed for new projects.

It goes without saying values are super important to us and we will do everything to make sure TNZ/ZNZ is ultimately protected and becomes one of the examples in the world of how security can be achieved while being cost effective and sustainable for the planet.


## Founder benefits

See the “[venture builder doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SDEiHUY-dDtr8REnUpK-L6trAPoacEuBvJMyTFjVK6Q/edit#)” at the reward pool section.


# 


# RISK MANAGEMENT


## 1.5x liquidation preference

The liquidation preference determines who gets paid first and how much they get paid when a company must be liquidated, such as the sale of the company. Typically, the company's investors or preferred stockholders get their money back first, ahead of other kinds of stockholders or debtholders, in the event that the company must be liquidated.

For instance, assuming the first investors in FreeFlow Labs invest $4,000,000 for 20% of the initial shares of the company at a share value of $2 with a liquidation preference of 1.5x. If the company is then sold for $24,000,000, the Round A investors would generate $6,000,000.

Conversely, if the company sells for $6,000,000, the Round A investors would receive $6,000,000 and the other shareholders would receive nothing. 


## Safe Structure 

Trading across Belgian borders is fast. It takes only one hour to complete the compliance requirements for export. This is one of the reasons why Belgium is ranked number one out of 190 economies in the category of trading across borders by the World Bank’s Doing Business report.

Belgium has a unique tax regime. Numerous corporate tax deductions are available, such as no capital gains, notional interest, and there is a very favorable taxation system for expat employees. Thanks to these measures, the effective corporate tax rate can be significantly lower than the nominal rate and lower than many other countries. In addition, the advanced tax ruling system provides legal certainty for investors.


## We operate in a huge market

The Internet is the second largest and fastest growing industry in the world after financial markets. The size of the Internet’s infrastructure is expected to triple in size this decade. Furthermore, the world is experiencing a digital renaissance — everything is turning digital. 

ThreeFold represents the only decentralized, scalable and efficient Internet infrastructure able to provide for all digital requirements at the edge — A complete blue ocean strategy in a +$10 Trillion industry.

**The world is changing in front of us, we cannot deny it and we need to act now.** \


We are in the forefront of a growing movement, more and more companies want to prioritize people and planet positive policies. We are not swimming against the stream, we are part of a group of leaders of change and realizing the zeitgeist of the 21st century. 

Companies and investors that fail to be part of this needed movement will seem like dinosaurs by 2030 and be valued by our communities accordingly.
